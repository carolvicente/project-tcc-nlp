 "{\"icon\":\"http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/9168c1b6145644ff5583f534e74e6b23?s=114\",\"author\":\"Mark Gurman\",\"text\":\"Seven years out from the original iPhone\\u2019s introduction, and four years past the iPad\\u2019s launch, Apple has found its next market ripe for reinvention: the mobile healthcare and fitness-tracking industry. Apple\\u2019s interest in healthcare and fitness tracking will be displayed in an iOS application codenamed Healthbook. I first wrote about Apple\\u2019s plans for Healthbook in January, and multiple sources working directly on the initiative\\u2019s development have since provided new details and images of Healthbook that provide a clearer view of Apple\\u2019s plans for dramatically transforming the mobile healthcare and fitness-tracking space\\u2026\\nThe Healthbook:\\nAs detailed in the images throughout this article, which are complete recreations of screenshots, Healthbook\\u2019s user interface is largely inspired by the iPhone\\u2019s existing Passbook application. Versions of Healthbook in testing are capable of tracking several different health and fitness data points.\\nEach category of functionality is a card in the Healthbook. Cards are distinguished by a color, and the tabs can be arranged to fit user preferences. As can be seen in the above images, Healthbook has sections that can track data pertaining to bloodwork, heart rate, hydration, blood pressure, physical activity, nutrition, blood sugar, sleep, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and weight.\\nWhile other publications have reported to the contrary, the images clearly show that Apple is working on tracking hydration levels. Also contradicting other reporting, these images do not indicate that Apple is working on tracking stress or pregnancy data points. It is possible that this type of functionality could arrive in the future, but I do not believe Apple is currently developing those capabilities.\\nFitness Functionality:\\nThree of Healthbook\\u2019s tabs are dedicated to fitness tracking: Activity, Weight, and Nutrition. Activity, which is pictured above, is similar to many other pieces of fitness tracking software on the App Store and other platforms. It tracks steps taken, calories burned, and miles walked.\\nAlso shown above, the Weight tab allows users to input their height and weight information to track statistics like BMI (Body Mass Index) and body fat percentage. Both the Activity and Weight functions allow users to track their fitness progress over the course of a day, week, month, and year. Each view includes a graph to visualize the progress over time.\\nThe Nutrition tab in Healthbook allows users to enter their food intake and maintain a diet. This functionality is similar to what apps from companies like Jawbone currently offer. Combining fitness activity, weight tracking, and diet management into one application is certainly a powerful combination for both fitness enthusiasts and those trying to watch what they eat.\\nI previously reported that Apple hired Jay Blahnik, a world-renowned fitness expert and motivational speaker, to work on future fitness-related products. Blahnik previously worked as a consultant for several fitness technology companies including Nike, and he is likely contributing to the development of Healthbook\\u2019s fitness functionality.\\nHeart Rate and Blood Pressure Monitoring:\\nHeart rate and blood pressure are two of the most widely known health-related measurements. Blood pressure is commonly checked at the doctor\\u2019s office, pharmacy, or home, while heart rate can be measured by iPhone apps, smartphone cameras, and gym equipment. Healthbook will be able to store and track heart rate/pulse data in BPM (beats per minute) as well as blood pressure data. Blood pressure will be recorded in both its diastolic (minimum) and systolic (peak) forms. Samsung\\u2019s upcoming Galaxy Gear Fit wearable device and the Withings Pulse can work with a smartphone to track heart rate, but those devices do not include blood pressure functionality.\\nBloodwork, Oxygen Saturation, and Blood Sugar Tracking:\\nThe blood monitoring capabilities of Healthbook are perhaps the most unique and important elements of the application. Blood tracking functionality is found in sections called Bloodwork, Oxygen Saturation, and Blood Sugar.\\nThe capabilities of the Bloodwork section are currently vague, but the tab can present several different blood-related data points normally provided by healthcare professionals and bloodwork labs. Hospitals often track blood data in yearly physicals for patients, including data points related to liver function, kidneys, thyroids, and the heart. Lab reports related to blood results are commonly distributed to patients through printouts, emails, or faxes. Using the latest software and hardware technology, it is possible that Apple wants to reinvent this process.\\nHealthbook can also track a person\\u2019s oxygen saturation. This refers to the percentage of oxygen that is in a person\\u2019s blood as a ratio to how much oxygen can possibly be stored in that person\\u2019s bloodstream. Oxygen saturation is important in the context of measuring a person\\u2019s respiratory rate (more on that below) and breathing quality. Many non-invasive devices for tracking oxygen saturation currently exist in the health tracking marketplace. Apple hired Dr. Michael O\\u2019Reilly last year, and he specializes in pulse oximeters, the technology used to measure oxygen saturation.\\nPerhaps most importantly, Healthbook can track blood sugar (glucose) levels. According to 2013 statistics from the American Diabetes Association, approximately 26 million individuals in the United States have diabetes. 1.9 million people in the United States are diagnosed each year, and 1 in 3 adults will have diabetes by the year 2050 if the current trend continues. To track their blood sugar, diabetics use blood checkers several times a day. That unfortunate hassle could be somewhat remedied by an advanced, Apple-built application preprogrammed into the iPhone.\\nJoe Madden, the creator of blood sugar monitoring application Gluco-Share, told me in an interview that Type 1 diabetics check their glucose levels approximately six times per day. On the other hand, Type 2 diabetics test their blood perhaps only a few times per week. Madden noted that those numbers ideally should be more in line, and that Apple\\u2019s entry into the market could create significant improvements in the lives of diabetics. Madden\\u2019s software includes incentives and social media integration, but it is unclear if Healthbook will offer similar capabilities. Regardless, in an App Store market with hundreds of blood sugar management apps (some of which are shown above), Healthbook could serve as an intuitive, centrally-located solution.\\nHydration and Respiratory Rate Measuring:\\nHydration levels and respiratory rate are two other interesting health data points that Apple is working on tracking with Healthbook. Hydration tracking is critical, especially for athletes, and allows users to know how much water is in their bodies and if they need to drink more fluids.\\nRespiratory rate is the measurement of the amount of breaths a person takes per minute. Respiratory rate data can be interpreted via the same technologies used to power the aforementioned blood oxygen level data, and there are not many known wearable devices that specialize in tracking respiratory rates currently.\\nSleep Tracking:\\nBesides tracking fitness and blood-related information, Healthbook will have the ability to track sleep cycles. Details on what exactly that entails are currently slim. However we previously broke the news that Apple hired one of the world\\u2019s experts in sleep tracking: Roy Raymann, and his experience may hold some answers. Before joining Apple, Raymann worked at Philips and founded the company\\u2019s \\u201cSleep Experience\\u201d laboratory. Raymann\\u2019s research into sleep focused on sleep patterns, sleep quality, and alertness. It is likely he has been contributing to the Sleep tab of Healthbook.\\nJawbone\\u2019s sleep tracking feature\\nSeveral sleep-tracking applications and related devices already exist on the market. Devices and applications from FitBit and Jawbone (pictured above) can track when users toss and turn at night, measure when they enter deep sleep, and determine when the best time is for the user to wake up. Application like and Sleepbot use advanced algorithms to track movement during sleep and provide users with graphs to present sleep quality over time. Based on Apple\\u2019s hires, it is likely Apple is working on the capability to track similar data within Healthbook.\\nEmergency Card:\\nIn addition to health and fitness tracking, Healthbook will be a centrally-located place that holds critical data about each iPhone user. The Emergency Card will store the customer\\u2019s name, birthdate, medication information, weight, eye color, blood type, organ donor status, and location. This information is critical for an emergency technician, doctor, or hospital staffer to identify and treat a user if they fall ill or become injured and are unable to speak for themselves.\\nThe Emergency Card feature will also allow users to add emergency contact information. With that feature, someone would be able to instantly called a pre-programmed phone number to a user\\u2019s family member, for example, to notify them of an emergency. In order to be truly useful, it seems plausible that this emergency information would be accessible from the iPhone\\u2019s Lock screen much like Passbook passes could appear on the Lock screen.\\nJoseph Ekman, who founded the non-profit organization , explained in an interview that he created an App Store application for tracking emergency information out of his personal experience with there being a lack of a standardized method of smartphones storing the pertinent details. With hundreds of millions of iPhones that will be capable of running Healthbook, Apple will be fulfilling Mr. Ekman\\u2019s vision of an Emergency Card standard.\\nSourcing Data: M7, App Store, Third-Party Devices, or iWatch?\\nWhile Healthbook is capable of tracking, sorting, and managing various types of health and fitness-related data, it is currently uncertain where this data will actually be sourced from. I believe that the data will be sourced from at least one of four possibilities: the iPhone itself, third-party App Store apps, third-party devices, or a future Apple wearable device (iWatch).\\nThanks to the capabilities of the iPhone 5s\\u2019s M7 motion co-processor, Healthbook could technically receive steps, miles walked, and caloric data from the iPhone itself. However, that is where the M7 stops being useful for Healthbook. Blood, hydration, and respiratory rate information would clearly need to come from other sources.\\nThe first possibility here would be that Healthbook serves as a unified place for all third-party health apps on an iPhone to store their data. Just like the similarly named Passbook is a central place for iPhone users to access movie tickets, coupons, and boarding passes from other apps, Healthbook could be a single place where iPhone users can collect data from their various health apps.\\nSimilarly, Healthbook could be a single place where the various existing third-party iOS-compatible health accessories can be set up and store their data. The ecosystem of health accessories for iPhones is plentiful, and Apple\\u2019s own online store sells fitness bands that can act as pedometers, digital weight scales, heart rate monitors, sleep trackers, pulse oximeters, and blood pressure checkers.\\nWith the existence of the M7 chip in recent Apple hardware, a plethora of health-related App Store apps, and several health accessories, Healthbook could very likely be a singular place for all the accompanying data to be stored and viewed.\\nHowever, that theory does not explain the hydration, respiratory rate, and blood sugar tracking functionality in Healthbook. There are not many (or any) proven accessories to track those health data points on the market. This perhaps opens the possibility that Healthbook is designed to work in tandem with a future wearable device from Apple.\\niWatch software head Kevin Lynch, fitness specialist Jay Blahnik, fashion expert Paul Deneve\\n, patents, and other evidence have indicated that Apple has long been working on a wearable computer with fitness and health-tracking functionality. Specifically, Apple has hired several engineers with specific experience in designing, building, and shipping medical sensors. The majority of the medical hardware-related hires focus on tracking blood sugar levels and scanning veins. Notable hires include executives and scientists from Senseonics, C8 MediSensors, Sano Intelligence, and Vital Connect.\\nSources have also indicated that Apple is working on a sensor-laden smartwatch, and that the device will synchronize with an iPhone over Bluetooth and other wireless technologies. Google is also working on its own smartwatch, but the Mountain View company\\u2019s device will likely focus on voice interaction and Google Now integration rather than medical sensors. Samsung recently introduced an updated line of smart watches, and one model supports basic health measurement functionality.\\nPointing to Apple developing a major new hardware product for 2014 is Apple\\u2019s own CEO Tim Cook. Cook recently told employees that Apple has \\u201cbig plans\\u201d in store for this year. Cook has also said on multiple occasions that Apple would be entering new product categories this year. Even with those comments, it is still unconfirmed if 2014 will bring Healthbook + iWatch or just Healthbook on its own for now. Regardless, Apple\\u2019s work on this application as well as numerous recent hires indicates that Apple is targeting fulfilling a vision of reinventing the health and fitness world.\\nDebut:\\nApple is said to currently be testing the Healthbook software with iOS 8, the next version of the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch operating system. However, it is possible that the application\\u2019s launch could be pushed back to a future operating system version or cancelled entirely. If the application is tied to an Apple-built device, the debut would likely be connected to that hardware and may not be introduced alongside other iOS 8 functionality during Apple\\u2019s mid-2014 Worldwide Developer\\u2019s Conference.\\nSources have also indicated that iOS 8 will retain most of iOS 7\\u2032s design and features, but it will likely feature improved Maps software with public transit directions support, a standalone iTunes Radio application to increase usage, refinements across the system, and enhanced iCloud integration.\\nWith hundreds of millions of existing iPhones and many more to be sold, Apple has the unique opportunity to recreate the health and fitness tracking market by pre-installing Healthbook in a future software update. After revamping the music, smartphone, and computing worlds with the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, Apple\\u2019s next big insight could be software for improving people\\u2019s lives. Just like tablets, pocket computers, and digital music players are now part of the mainstream, Healthbook may just be able to transform healthcare and fitness management for the betterment of society.\\n97 Responses to \\u201cThis is Healthbook, Apple\\u2019s major first step into health & fitness tracking\\u201d\\nThis is one of the worst Apple leaks in a long time; actual screenshots, the precise things the iWatch presumably tracks, the look and design of it all..\\nWhoever is doing this leaking is probably (hopefully?) gonna get found out and fired. The fact there\\u2019s an enormous team working on iWatch for years without even a peep (other than the inescapable fact itself of some kind of wearable), then somebody working on the iWatch\\u2019s partnered app is leaking screenshots.. smh.\\nUnfortunately, one big obstacle in the way of all these new healthcare apps and devices, in the USA, is our overzealous FDA. This overgrown agency is actually attempting to regulate phone apps in the same way as implantable medical devices. What\\u2019s more, the FDA is responsible for gutting the service 23AndMe provided, forcing them to remove their health results, allowing only ancestry results to be shown.\\nI\\u2019m glad Apple is entering this market, because they will have enough lobbyists to hopefully help get some favorable laws passed, to rein in the FDA.

Raw fitness and health data is useless and me-too from every wearable device without data mining and useful actions on how the user can leverage those metrics.\\nFitness and health tracking is targeting mostly consumers but don\\u2019t forget insurance companies, hospitals, nursing homes, etc. The demographics is huge\\u2026\\nMost iOS add-on devices does not claim to be a medical device to bypass FDA approval. So for those that require FDA approval, they will be coming but will be a lot slower to the market. I agree with you that Apple will NOT be launching any FDA-approved devices.\\nThe ideal scenario \\u2013 a health ecosystem on an iPhone app or on a cloud platform where every vendor can plug-and-play is the best for consumers.You can pick any form factor that suits you (I think the watch is the best after testing so many wrist-, clip-, and ankle-based activity trackers) and they all get uploaded and analyzed on the fitness and health ecosystem or cloud platform servers.\",\"title\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple\\u2019s major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"images\":[{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/fitness-1.png?w=788&h=394\"},{\"primary\":\"true\",\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthbook-book.jpg?w=704&h=622\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthbook-cards.jpg?w=704&h=622\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/heartblood.png?w=704&h=349\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/bloodworkbloodsugaroxygensat.png?w=704&h=349\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-15-at-11-39-04-am.png?w=704&h=371\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/hydrationrespiratory.png?w=704&h=349\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/jb.png?w=704&h=525\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthbook-emergency.jpg?w=704&h=620\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-15-at-2-17-16-am.png?w=704&h=495\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/onlinestore.png?w=704&h=453\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/wearables.png?w=676&h=338\"},{\"caption\":\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\",\"url\":\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthbookios2.png?w=295&h=279\"}],\"html\":\"<div><div class=\\\"main-content\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\\"article-content\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><img alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"394\\\" src=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/fitness-1.png?w=788&h=394\\\" title=\\\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\\\" width=\\\"788\\\"><\\/img><\\/p>\\n<p>Seven years out from the original iPhone&rsquo;s introduction, and four years past the iPad&rsquo;s launch, Apple has found its next market ripe for reinvention: the mobile healthcare and fitness-tracking industry.&nbsp;Apple&rsquo;s interest in healthcare and fitness tracking will be displayed in an iOS application codenamed Healthbook. I <a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.com/2014/01/31/iwatch-ios-8-apple-sets-out-to-redefine-mobile-health-fitness-tracking/\\\">first wrote about Apple&rsquo;s plans for Healthbook in January<\\/a>, and multiple sources working directly on the initiative&rsquo;s development have since provided new details and images of Healthbook that provide a clearer view of Apple&rsquo;s plans for dramatically transforming the mobile healthcare and fitness-tracking space&hellip;<\\/p>\\n<p><span id=\\\"more-314915\\\"><\\/span>\\n\\t\\t\\t<\\/p><div class=\\\"inlinead\\\" id=\\\"author-ad\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t<\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\n<p><\\/p>\\n<h3><strong>The Healthbook:<\\/strong><\\/h3>\\n<p>As detailed in the images throughout this article, which are complete recreations of screenshots, Healthbook&rsquo;s user interface is largely inspired by the iPhone&rsquo;s existing Passbook application. Versions of Healthbook in testing are capable of tracking several different health and fitness data points.<\\/p>\\n<p><img alt=\\\"Healthbook Book\\\" class=\\\"size-large wp-image-314916 aligncenter diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"622\\\" src=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthbook-book.jpg?w=704&h=622\\\" title=\\\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\\\" width=\\\"704\\\"><\\/img><\\/p>\\n<p>Each category of functionality is a card in the Healthbook. Cards are distinguished by a color, and the tabs can be arranged to fit user preferences. As can be seen in the above images, Healthbook has sections that can track data pertaining to bloodwork, heart rate, hydration, blood pressure, physical activity, nutrition, blood sugar, sleep, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and weight.<\\/p>\\n<p>While other publications have&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.com/2014/02/11/some-mockups-and-more-about-ios-8s-upcoming-healthbook-app-and-iwatch/\\\">reported to the contrary<\\/a>, the images clearly show that Apple is working on tracking hydration levels. Also contradicting other reporting, these images do not indicate that Apple is working on tracking stress or pregnancy data points. It is possible that this type of functionality could arrive in the future, but I do not believe Apple is currently developing those capabilities.<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthbook-cards.jpg\\\"><img alt=\\\"Healthbook Cards\\\" class=\\\"size-large wp-image-314919 aligncenter diffbot_image\\\" src=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/healthbook-cards.jpg?w=704&h=622\\\" title=\\\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\\\"><\\/img><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<h3><strong>Fitness Functionality:<\\/strong><\\/h3>\\n<p>Three of Healthbook&rsquo;s tabs are dedicated to fitness tracking: Activity, Weight, and Nutrition. Activity, which is pictured above, is similar to many other pieces of fitness tracking software on the App Store and other platforms. It tracks steps taken, calories burned, and miles walked.<\\/p>\\n<p>Also shown above, the Weight tab allows users to input their height and weight information to track statistics like BMI (Body Mass Index) and body fat percentage. Both the Activity and Weight functions allow users to track their fitness progress over the course of a day, week, month, and year. Each view includes a graph to visualize the progress over time.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Nutrition tab in Healthbook allows users to enter their food intake and maintain a diet. This functionality is similar to what apps from companies like Jawbone currently offer. Combining fitness activity, weight tracking, and diet management into one application is certainly a powerful combination for both fitness enthusiasts and those trying to watch what they eat.<\\/p>\\n<p>I <a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.com/2013/08/17/key-nike-fuelband-developer-confirms-new-job-at-apple-likely-working-on-iwatch/\\\">previously reported that Apple hired Jay Blahnik<\\/a>, a world-renowned fitness expert and motivational speaker, to work on future fitness-related products. Blahnik previously worked as a consultant for several fitness technology companies including Nike, and he is likely contributing to the development of Healthbook&rsquo;s fitness functionality.<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/heartblood.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"HeartBlood\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-314940 diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"349\\\" src=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/heartblood.png?w=704&h=349\\\" title=\\\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\\\" width=\\\"704\\\"><\\/img><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<h3><b>Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Monitoring:<\\/b><\\/h3>\\n<p>Heart rate and blood pressure are two of the most widely known health-related measurements. Blood pressure is commonly checked at the doctor&rsquo;s office, pharmacy, or home, while heart rate can be measured by iPhone apps, <a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.com/2014/02/24/samsung-announces-galaxy-s5-w-heart-rate-sensor-fingerprint-scanner-curved-fitness-wearable/\\\">smartphone cameras<\\/a>, and gym equipment.&nbsp;Healthbook will be able to store and track heart rate/pulse data in BPM (beats per minute) as well as blood pressure data. Blood pressure will be recorded in both its diastolic (minimum) and systolic (peak) forms. Samsung&rsquo;s upcoming Galaxy Gear Fit wearable device and the Withings Pulse can work with a smartphone to track heart rate, but those devices do not include blood pressure functionality.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/bloodworkbloodsugaroxygensat.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"BloodworkBloodSugarOxygenSat\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-314991 diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"349\\\" src=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/bloodworkbloodsugaroxygensat.png?w=704&h=349\\\" title=\\\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\\\" width=\\\"704\\\"><\\/img><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<h3><strong>Bloodwork, Oxygen Saturation, and Blood Sugar Tracking:<\\/strong><\\/h3>\\n<p>The blood monitoring capabilities of Healthbook are perhaps the most unique and important elements of the application. Blood tracking functionality is found in sections called Bloodwork, Oxygen Saturation, and Blood Sugar.<\\/p>\\n<p>The capabilities of the Bloodwork section are currently vague, but the tab can&nbsp;present several different blood-related data points normally provided by healthcare professionals and bloodwork labs.&nbsp;Hospitals often track blood data in yearly physicals for patients, including data points related to liver function, kidneys, thyroids, and the heart. Lab reports related to blood results are commonly distributed to patients through printouts, emails, or faxes. Using the latest software and hardware technology, it is possible that Apple wants to reinvent this process.<\\/p>\\n<p>Healthbook can also track a person&rsquo;s oxygen saturation. This refers to the percentage of oxygen that is in a person&rsquo;s blood as a ratio to how much oxygen can possibly be stored in that person&rsquo;s bloodstream. Oxygen saturation is important in the context of measuring a person&rsquo;s respiratory rate (more on that below) and breathing quality. Many non-invasive devices for tracking oxygen saturation currently exist in the health tracking marketplace. Apple&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.com/2014/01/30/apple-hired-medical-expert-michael-oreilly-last-summer-not-working-solely-on-iwatch/\\\">hired Dr. Michael O&rsquo;Reilly last year<\\/a>, and he specializes in pulse oximeters, the technology used to measure oxygen saturation.<\\/p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-15-at-11-39-04-am.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"Screen Shot 2014-03-15 at 11.39.04 AM\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-314972 diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"371\\\" src=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-15-at-11-39-04-am.png?w=704&h=371\\\" title=\\\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\\\" width=\\\"704\\\"><\\/img><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, Healthbook can track blood sugar (glucose) levels.&nbsp;According to 2013 statistics from the American Diabetes Association, approximately 26 million individuals in the United States have diabetes. 1.9 million people in the United States are diagnosed each year, and 1 in 3 adults will have diabetes by the year 2050 if the current trend continues. To track their blood sugar, diabetics use blood checkers several times a day. That unfortunate hassle could be somewhat remedied by an advanced, Apple-built application preprogrammed into the iPhone.<\\/p>\\n<p>Joe Madden, the creator of <a href=\\\"http://www.gluco-share.org\\\">blood sugar monitoring application Gluco-Share<\\/a>, told me in an interview that Type 1 diabetics check their glucose levels approximately six times per day. On the other hand, Type 2 diabetics test their blood perhaps only a few times per week. Madden noted that those numbers ideally should be more in line, and that Apple&rsquo;s entry into the market could create significant improvements in the lives of diabetics. Madden&rsquo;s <a href=\\\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gluco-share/id515888967?mt=8\\\">software includes<\\/a> incentives and social media integration, but it is unclear if Healthbook will offer similar capabilities. Regardless, in an App Store market with hundreds of blood sugar management apps (some of which are shown above), Healthbook could serve as an intuitive, centrally-located solution.<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/hydrationrespiratory.png\\\"><img alt=\\\"HydrationRespiratory\\\" class=\\\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-314990 diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"349\\\" src=\\\"http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/hydrationrespiratory.png?w=704&h=349\\\" title=\\\"This is Healthbook, Apple's major first step into health & fitness tracking\\\" width=\\\"704\\\"><\\/img><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<h3><strong>Hydration and Respiratory Rate Measuring:<\\/strong><\\/h3>\\n<p>Hydration levels and respiratory rate are two other interesting health data points that Apple is working on tracking with Healthbook.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://mybema.com/assets/favicon-3a77c4985f5ffcf0ed1ac9b347760588.ico\",\"text\":\"Warning: there are A LOT of tips below. Do not try to click and them off in a single sitting! (We'll remember your completed points even if you close your browser window)\\nBefore engaging with anyone outside of your company, you first need to know how you're going to respond. Everyone that interacts with the outside world needs to understand how to handle situations, good or bad. Your team needs to know what to do when there's a crisis. They'll need to know how to resolve issues or where to look when questions need answering. Documentation is critical as a fallback tool and workflows and communication tactics are essential. Even if your plan is informal and rudimentary, create one for your company, or make sure that one exists. If you need some resources to get you started, check out the guide on how to create a customer service plan or this summary of an effective customer service plan.\\nRegardless of how busy you are or how many things you need to finish, always acknowledge the existence of your customers. Even if you cannot get to them immediately, let them know that you will as soon as you can. Try to become available for an initial touch point before they become impatient. Do not let them feel like they have to interrupt you to get your attention. If you have 99 customers to deal with and another one walks in only to be ignored, yet you've attended to all of your other customers, your delivery rate will be 99%. However, to that one customer your brand failed to deliver 100% of the time.\\nTrust is far too fragile a thing to brush aside or abuse, and it takes much longer to build than to destroy. If you make a promise to a customer or tell them that you or your team will do something by a certain deadline, then make sure that it happens. Even if you pass on the responsibility of delivery onto a teammate, try to follow up on it as best as you can. Follow-ups help to ensure that your team delivers on the promises you've made. Otherwise you can jeopardize the reliability of your brand.\\nTry to be as friendly and empathetic as you can when you are representing your brand. This doesn't mean that you have to force yourself to be a bubbly extrovert when you aren't one, but you should at least be amiable to everyone you interact with. Asking people how they are and telling them to have a good day while being sincere about it should be a goal for each person you interact with. Telling someone that they're welcome to ask you a question if they're still uncertain about something in future can go a long way toward them reaching out to your brand a second time.\\nAssisting someone with a query is great, but you should always try to determine whether the person secretly has something else they need assistance with. They may not want to tell you or they may not even know that they do. Helping somebody will satisfy that person. Helping somebody beyond the scope of their original query can make their encounter memorable. However, going overboard for every single customer may lead to burnout, so try not to give it 110% as an individual all the time.\\nCustomer service skills include people skills. Our people-skills, as easy as they seem to be, are often not as great as we think they are. Service companies should run workshops with professional consultants to highlight these weaknesses. Training sessions may uncover negative nuances that consumer-facing staff could be portraying during customer interactions. Decent people-skills require practice and training sessions to master and keep mastered. Subtle expressions of impatience can completely destroy a service experience from a customer's perspective. Make sure to always restrain yourself even when they do frustrate you.\\nIf some of the people you serve or respond to are the same people you interact with on a regular basis then getting to know them a bit better can go a long way. In person, it helps you build rapport and can even help towards instilling a sense of loyalty to your brand. Digitally, it helps having a CRM system so that you can understand the context of queries as well a person's history. Simple information like this makes consumers feel more valued than you treating them as a stranger each time.\\nThings don't always work perfectly and sometimes it is necessary to take responsibility for failure. Even if it means that some customers may vent at you for your admission, most of them will be forgiving. If you accept responsibility, even when something happening is not your fault, you prevent your customers from perceiving your brand as yet another one where everyone at the company passes the buck. That kind of perception destroys trust.\\nThe first step to developing insight into your services, products or brand in general is via feedback and data. The second step is to make proper use of the feedback. A static collection of texts will provide you with a crude and rudimentary overview of your performance. It won't allow you to understand in detail just what aspects of your service need improvement. However, rudimentary overviews are still better than not recording anything at all.\\nMake every attempt to respond to everyone that contacts you or comments about your brand. It is beneficial to respond even if the message is somewhat irrelevant, hurtful or even off-topic. Acknowledging people reaffirms that your brand is listening and is engaged with the audience. It may also encourage them reach out to you next time they have a problem because they know your brand will respond to them. Participating in a community and conversing about tangential topics with your audience may lead them to contacting you about issues around your industry. This is a great lead warming tactic as well.\\nIf you are the owner of a small business or work as part of a team that doesn't explicitly have customer service representatives then this tip is for you. Set some time aside every day and dedicate it to responding to queries and inbound communication. Having a stretch of time that allows you to get back to people without feeling pressured to complete tasks that seem more important will mean that you don't have to feel flooded by what seems like a constant stream of incoming requests.\\nWhen people communicate with your brand, they are providing you with feedback that you would not have otherwise received. Listen intently and not just with one ear. The details may reveal subtle things that you may not pick up if you are only listening to someone just so you can help them along and move onto another task or person. The devil is in the details, and that's also where your attention should be.\\nAlways thank your customers, a lot. They're paying you, giving you feedback, and referring you to their friends. They're spending time interacting with you and care enough to want to fix problems instead of moving to your competitors. Be grateful and let them know. A simple and sincere thank you can go a really long way. As a representative of your company, to some customers, you are your company. Here's an anecdote to remind you that a good attitude and a simple thank you can go a long way, or how sometimes the absence of politeness may land you in hot water.\\nIt's almost impossible to over-communicate to your customers. We don't mean directly message them, or spam them with information to their inboxes. We mean that you should make as much information available to them as possible. Give your information a decent design and add it to your website, your Facebook page, or periodically tweet about it. The more information you provide your market with, the less they'll have to contact you directly to resolve their queries or to answer their questions.\\nBoring, formal, corporate language should be used internally (if that's your thing). Your customers are humans so treat them like humans by talking to them in clear and simple terms. Do not use obtuse lawyer-speak and don't drown people in industry-esoteric jargon. Be clear because the sooner you resolve the query, the sooner you can do something else or help someone else. You'll resolve the query sooner if everyone is on the same page. Here are 10 tips on avoiding this type of bloated language.\\nIf somebody asks a question that you don't know the answer to, do not wait to reply until you find the answer first. Let people know that their query is being attended to and keep them updated if it's going to take a while. People can be patient but the situation has to be reasonable, keep it reasonable by keeping them informed. You wouldn't leave your boss uninformed for days if her or she asked you to do something so remember to treat your clients with the same respect.\\nAlways spend an extra minute or two to proofread your outgoing emails. Check for spelling, grammar and punctuation mistakes and always maintain a pleasant and welcoming tone. Use emoticons only when appropriate and not too often. If you need information from a person before you can resolve their query, make it very clear what you need or what they need to do. It goes without saying that you should never write in all-caps. You may want to consult this comprehensive list of email etiquette rules.\\nIf your company has a system that allows people to provide feedback, stop and take some time to ensure that the feedback is being taken into consideration and isn't going to waste. If you cannot action that feedback then make sure that the person that can has seen it. Nothing will change if feedback is left collecting dust. Additionally, in order to optimize your feedback gathering strategy, you may want to know how to design a Voice of the Customer programme.\\nTake some time to help mentor new colleagues and fellow staff members about the importance of service excellence. Teaching everyone in the company about being customer-centric is the only way to actually make your company be customer-centric. It doesn't have to be part of your job role to share insights with your colleagues on the company intranet or chatroom.\\nEnsure that your company has laid out service standards that are measurable and specific enough to be able to fix when the standards are not being met. Be explicit with the actions that need to be taken to meet those standards and that they match the service qualities that your company values. The CEO should be the person outlining these standards or at least collaborating in defining them.\\nYour company should reward great service both formally and informally. Service performance that gets rewarded formally as well as informally as part of the company culture (instead of a run-of-the-mill employee of the month) is what achieves great customer service. Keeping it fun will reinforce people's commitment and strategies like group leaderboards help catalyze a friendly competitive environment.\\nAt times, the amount of available time you have may be very limited. When things are chaotic, you may feel that there are far more important things to do and that service must go on the back burner. Your customers never see it that way, to them good service should be your primary priority. If you want to convince your colleagues that they should see it as a priority, show them that you see it that way too and lead by example.\\nIf you do not already do this then consider providing a way for your customers to give you feedback about your company and your services. You should also provide a way for your staff members or colleagues to record feedback about what the customers they speak to think is important.\\nHave your company use tools that allow you to record feedback, deliver excellent customer support across whatever channels you support, and also make your company customer-centric. This may be one tool or a suite of tools but know that the customer support tools should not dictate how your company is structured. Your values come first and the tools and processes should follow. Use them in a way that allows you to be productive and capable of satisfying your customers.\\nAsk and you'll probably receive. Getting feedback and getting your customers to write reviews about your brand requires you to ask them to do it. If you want enough reviews to have enough data to make real changes then actively drive your customers to write them. If your brand uses a preferred third party review platform then ask people to review your interactions, whether good or bad, after each of your support calls. It has been claimed that positive reviews can increase sales by 58%.\\nThe quicker you understand a customer's problem, the quicker you can help them resolve it. As obvious as it may seem, getting clarity about a situation isn't always as simple as it may seem. In order to avoid misunderstandings, first make sure that you understand the premise of a customer's argument and ensure that they understand the details needed to move forward, in the simplest way possible. Once every premise is clearly defined and understood by all parties, progress to a resolution will have fewer obstacles to overcome.\\nEven though it may not strictly be part of your working agreement try to add a bit of additional effort and enthusiasm when dealing with people. People are great at picking up body language and they can easily pick up your positivity. This helps relieve some tension in unpleasant scenarios but also helps to concretize good experiences in the minds of your clients.\\nService level agreements are often part of service contracts and are almost always a strong selling point. Upholding those SLAs is important if you want you customers to keep trusting you to deliver what you have promised. In order for that to happen the agreements need to be realistic and unambiguous. They should be clearly understood by your customers and all of your support staff should understand them and do everything possible to guarantee that they are fulfilled.\\nA customer-centric philosophy is a good start in wanting to achieve a goal of delivering good customer service. In order for it to remain a constant there needs to be some leadership in the support team. Leaders need to be champions of amazing and consistent customer support and need to inspire everyone else in the team to imitate them. A lack of this type of role can lead to dwindling in motivation to continue to deliver. If there is no current leader, volunteer to step up, either formally or informally simply by sticking to the outlined philosophy and being vocal enough that your teammates join you.\\nThe majority of support queries will relate to a small set of problems whose solutions are well documented but the odd curveball is inevitable. The support team should be able to have the power to attempt to resolve those issues without having to resort to a helping or permissive hand first. Every support member should be a problem solver and not a message conduit, as much as is possible. Product and process training is the best way to equip everyone on the frontline with enough knowledge to be able to at least confidently try to tackle every problem without having to resort to more senior staff or passing customers around.\\nAt times, we're all guilty of not actively listening. Instead what we do is we begin formulating responses before the person we're listening to has even finished speaking. Mistakes like that mean that we sometimes miss out on important details which prevent us from resolving an issue the first time around because we'll have to backtrack at a later stage to recover those details. Good scientists collect as much data as they can and do not begin to analyze it until they're satisfied with the amount they have. Just as they listen to the data first, customer-facing agents should listen to queries before theorizing problems and considering solutions that may actually be time-costly.\\nRapport is a great asset to have with repeat customers for many reasons, but it's useful for once-off callers as well. Rapport creates a bond, which opens up trust and better communication. People may reveal things if they trust you that they wouldn't otherwise and you never know how that may speed up your resolution process. Rapport takes some amount of social skill to be able to build up in a single conversation, but simple things like personalized [written] communication and using a person's name can be great catalysts. Here are some tips on effectively building up rapport.\\nIt's not actually good enough to tell clients that you will get back to them later in the day or week. If you need to find something out and get back to a person, give yourself a deadline and let them know exactly when that deadline is. It's alright to email or to phone them up and let them know you're still working on it, but it's not alright to keep them in the dark. In fact it's more frustrating for them to wonder if you really will get back to them than you telling them you don't know how to deal with something and that you've had to pull in a colleague to help you.\\nYour company may provide a service that's critical to the business of your clients, such as Internet connectivity or hosting, financial services or physical telecoms. When your products stop working for them then your company becomes the bottleneck in their workflow. Perhaps you can't anything to fix it directly but what you can do is facilitate the matter as one of urgency to ensure that those who can resolve it will resolve it. If the problem is one that blocks other work from happening, the manner in which you handle it for your client can be either a real feather in your cap or a black eye to your company's reputation.\\nSpontaneously reward your customers with small gifts. Feature upgrades, data bundles, real-life gifts, and things of that sort go a long way in turning even your on-the-fence customers into raging brand ambassadors. Making your customers feel loved, coupled with great service will only help in decreasing your churn rate and increasing the lifetime value of your customers. The costs of the rewards become negligible in light of the elevated LTVs and referrals you'll get from the customers that love you most.\\nThere is a lot to customer service and even more when it comes to amazing customer service. Even to veteran staff members who have gone through countless hours of training, more training is not a bad thing. Even the most experienced computer programmers spend time on tiny exercises coding away at the basic principles of programming. There is no doubt that they understand it but refinement is an ongoing process and the best programmers are the ones that practice their fundamental skills often. Having team discussions about customer service on a regular basis can bubble up hidden weaknesses, and having consultants from tangential fields and industries can always open up ideas that haven't been exposed before.\\nSome of your staff will have more knowledge about specific things than others and a lot of this knowledge will be tacit. The best thing your company can do to try to keep everyone on the same level is to create a culture of sharing. Whether that is done via an internal tool like Yammer or a wiki, it is important that it is done somehow. You may know something and assume that everyone else knows it too but there are a lot of seemingly obvious things that other people have never even heard of. Documentation is notoriously difficult to keep up-to-date but remember that many hands make light work. Share and collaborate to strengthen your team's knowledge.\\nThe fact is that some people don't want to interact with other people to resolve an issue. Some studies even show that more people prefer self-help than dealing with another human. This insight means that self-help facilities are in demand. The first thing to do to set up a self-help culture around your product or service is to have documentation available. Make certain that there is plenty of up-to-date information available and accessible to people. Self-help facilities open up your staff to dealing with urgent queries. They also please customers that wouldn't want to deal with humans anyway. Self-help even allows people to help themselves in the middle of the night should they need to.\\nSometimes frustrated people will lash out at you and be unreasonable. They may even be completely in the wrong. Despite this, you must remain empathetic. Try to uncover why they believe the incorrect facts that they do and help them understand things. Also help them prevent misunderstanding those facts in future. Empathy lets you to understand their vulnerable point of view and can prevent you from coming across as uncaring or defensive. Even if you cannot help them and they remain disappointed, they'll remember speaking to a human as opposed to a script reader.\\nBeing able to improve requires being able to understand how you're currently performing. That can only be done through measurement. This may mean using tools or processes that allow you to track metrics such as the ratio of positive to negative feedback, time to first response, time to resolution, and ratio of issues successfully resolved to those left unresolved. Do not start tracking everything if you don't track anything yet or you'll begin to feel overwhelmed very quickly. Track a few things, preferably the metrics around customer satisfaction and service quality levels, and add new metrics as they're required.\\nUnderstanding the demographics and general details of your consumer base and target market will allow you to structure how you market and respond to them. Knowing this will also mean being able to write content that your audience understands right off the bat. A bank wouldn't refer to their clients as dudes, but your business may very well do so. Context is important, and if you know what type of communication your market is comfortable with, you will increase your conversion and retention rates.\\nHaving to deal with a customer more than once about the same issue will no doubt be frustrating to that person. It will also become frustrating to you, the agent dealing with the issue. The longer a problem goes unresolved, the less motivated a representative will be to resolve it. This is because it means dealing with an ever more frustrated person that may be prone to being abusive. Being able to fix something within the first one or two interactions means retaining a high satisfaction rate for both the representative and the customer. A first call resolution rate of less than 100% means that there are some customers that your team are frustrating and turning into flight risks.\\nAs well as you may currently be doing your job, there will be ways that you can improve. Asking colleagues for feedback is as valuable as asking for feedback from customers after you satisfy their request. The level of service cannot remain static or it will erode as time goes by. Continuous service improvement is a must if delivery levels are to remain high.\\nTo say that you're going to under promise and over deliver is a bit of a clich\u00e9, but it's a clich\u00e9 for a reason. Under-promising within reason gives you a bit of leeway with which to complete a task. So it's better to promise to do what is requested of you (in a reasonable amount of time) and then throw in a little extra wherever you can. You may not always be able to over-deliver, but make sure to never under-deliver.\\nIt's important to get feedback from your company's staff as well as your customers' perceptions of the levels of customer service. According to IBM, 80% of CEOs think they deliver superior experience whereas only 8% of their customers agreed with them. That is a massive discrepancy in opinion and you should keep it in check as time goes by. Achieve this by doing surveys frequently enough to prevent the opinions of executives from living in a vacuum. If the executive team thinks that service levels are amazing, there is less incentive for them to take corrective measures or improve the levels of service in reality.\\nIf your company has enough time and resources to do so then it should try to follow up with customers that have had issues. Following up is a great way of impressing customers. Once someone in your team resolves an issue or answers a query, the next step is to show that customer that they weren't just a number in the queue. You can achieve this via a quick phone call or email (after some period of time) asking if everything is working as should be. Couple that with a prompt for some feedback of quality, and you can go a long way toward building a relationship.\\nSome clients will seem like thorns in your side no matter how hard you try, but that doesn't mean that trying is futile. It's worth remembering that a person with enough conviction to be unhappy with you has enough emotional capacity to love your company. That is, once they're finally won over again. Unhappy customers hold vital insights into some of the things you're doing wrong as a team. That's information that you can use to fix your process before more new customers turn unhappy.\\nTwo-way communication\\nYou may often need a customer to furnish you with enough information to be able to help them. Likewise, you too must keep the customer in the loop about what it is you're actually doing to help them. If you're helping someone by means of a telephone call then let him or her know why it is you'll be putting them on hold. Tell your customer the reasons for why you have to grill them with several questions, instead of leaving them to feel like you're interrogating them.\\nWhen helping someone that has few remaining options available to them, steer clear of reminding them of what they cannot do to resolve their issue. Before contacting you they've probably asked someone or read up on what can or cannot be done. Guide them by listing all the options you know that they will have available to them. Advise them and genuinely try to help them out as best as you can. Nobody likes being told that they have no options available to them.\\nEven if your process seems to be loved by your users or customers, it could be even better. The only way to know for sure is to test different approaches. The service team should periodically introduce different approaches, no matter how small, and try those approaches out on different segments. This sort of split testing will reveal which approaches yield the best results, allowing you to change them, or improve confidence levels that the current approach is the best possible one. Be sure to test one thing at a time in order to keep the results clean.\\nFocusing on retaining your existing client base is one of the best things you can do in terms of service and revenue flow. It is significantly cheaper and easier to keep existing customers happy than it is to find new ones and then trying to convert them into customers. You'll have to then impress those new customers enough in order to make them love you, stay with you and tell their friends about you. Spending time keeping your current customers happy is a step in securing them as future customers, which is essentially free revenue. You may be interested in these retention marketing tactics.\\nIf you have a page on your website where users can fill in a form to contact you, or can chat to you directly via a widget, be sure to track those activities. If you set up event tracking with tools like Kissmetrics then with enough time and data you'll be able to measure if you have a high contact form abandonment rate. If there are people that want to contact you but never actually fill out of submit the form, you're losing out on feedback and potentially even customers. You need to fix problems like this, and the best way to get started is by setting up tracking so that your decisions can be data-driven.\\nIt may be tempting to upsell to a person after having successfully helped them with a problem, but upselling should be used with caution. You can very easily destroy the rapport you've just built up with someone if you come off as too aggressive in your upselling pitch which can undo your work. Having long term clients is better than some short-term padding on your sales sheet.\\nThere's a lot to remember here so bookmark this page and focus on roughly 4 points every week.

Do not let them feel like they have to interrupt you to get your attention. If you have 99 customers to deal with and another one walks in only to be ignored, yet you've attended to all of your other customers, your delivery rate will be 99%. However, to that one customer your brand failed to deliver 100% of the time.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-3\\\">\\nTrust is far too fragile a thing to brush aside or abuse, and it takes much longer to build than to destroy. If you make a promise to a customer or tell them that you or your team will do something by a certain deadline, then make sure that it happens. Even if you pass on the responsibility of delivery onto a teammate, try to follow up on it as best as you can. Follow-ups help to ensure that your team delivers on the promises you've made. Otherwise you can jeopardize the reliability of your brand.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-4\\\">\\nTry to be as friendly and empathetic as you can when you are representing your brand. This doesn't mean that you have to force yourself to be a bubbly extrovert when you aren't one, but you should at least be amiable to everyone you interact with. Asking people how they are and telling them to have a good day while being sincere about it should be a goal for each person you interact with. Telling someone that they're welcome to ask you a question if they're still uncertain about something in future can go a long way toward them reaching out to your brand a second time.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-5\\\">\\nAssisting someone with a query is great, but you should always try to determine whether the person secretly has something else they need assistance with. They may not want to tell you or they may not even know that they do. Helping somebody will satisfy that person. Helping somebody beyond the scope of their original query can make their encounter memorable. However, going overboard for every single customer may lead to burnout, so try <a href=\\\"http://champperformance.com/when-giving-110-is-bad-for-the-team/\\\">not to give it 110%<\\/a> as an individual all the time.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-6\\\">\\nCustomer service skills include people skills. Our people-skills, as easy as they seem to be, are often not as great as we think they are. Service companies should run workshops with professional consultants to highlight these weaknesses. Training sessions may uncover negative nuances that consumer-facing staff could be portraying during customer interactions. Decent people-skills require practice and training sessions to master and keep mastered. Subtle expressions of impatience can completely destroy a service experience from a customer's perspective. Make sure to always restrain yourself even when they do frustrate you.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-7\\\">\\nIf some of the people you serve or respond to are the same people you interact with on a regular basis then getting to know them a bit better can go a long way. In person, it helps you build rapport and can even help towards instilling a sense of loyalty to your brand. Digitally, it helps having a CRM system so that you can understand the context of queries as well a person's history. Simple information like this makes consumers feel more valued than you treating them as a stranger each time.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-8\\\">\\nThings don't always work perfectly and sometimes it is necessary to take responsibility for failure. Even if it means that some customers may vent at you for your admission, most of them will be forgiving. If you accept responsibility, even when something happening is not your fault, you prevent your customers from perceiving your brand as yet another one where everyone at the company passes the buck. That kind of perception destroys trust.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-9\\\">\\nThe first step to developing insight into your services, products or brand in general is via feedback and data. The second step is to make proper use of the feedback. A static collection of texts will provide you with a crude and rudimentary overview of your performance. It won't allow you to understand in detail just what aspects of your service need improvement. However, rudimentary overviews are still better than not recording anything at all.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-10\\\">\\nMake every attempt to respond to everyone that contacts you or comments about your brand. It is beneficial to respond even if the message is somewhat irrelevant, hurtful or even off-topic. Acknowledging people reaffirms that your brand is listening and is engaged with the audience. It may also encourage them reach out to you next time they have a problem because they know your brand will respond to them. Participating in a community and conversing about tangential topics with your audience may lead them to contacting you about issues around your industry. This is a great lead warming tactic as well.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-11\\\">\\nIf you are the owner of a small business or work as part of a team that doesn't explicitly have customer service representatives then this tip is for you. Set some time aside every day and dedicate it to responding to queries and inbound communication. Having a stretch of time that allows you to get back to people without feeling pressured to complete tasks that seem more important will mean that you don't have to feel flooded by what seems like a constant stream of incoming requests.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-12\\\">\\nWhen people communicate with your brand, they are providing you with feedback that you would not have otherwise received. Listen intently and not just with one ear. The details may reveal subtle things that you may not pick up if you are only listening to someone just so you can help them along and move onto another task or person. The devil is in the details, and that's also where your attention should be.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-13\\\">\\nAlways thank your customers, a lot. They're paying you, giving you feedback, and referring you to their friends. They're spending time interacting with you and care enough to want to fix problems instead of moving to your competitors. Be grateful and let them know. A simple and sincere thank you can go a really long way. As a representative of your company, to some customers, you are your company. <a href=\\\"http://www.hyken.com/hire-right/1130/\\\">Here's an anecdote<\\/a> to remind you that a good attitude and a simple thank you can go a long way, or how sometimes the absence of politeness may land you in hot water.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-14\\\">\\nIt's almost impossible to over-communicate to your customers. We don't mean directly message them, or spam them with information to their inboxes. We mean that you should make as much information available to them as possible. Give your information a decent design and add it to your website, your Facebook page, or periodically tweet about it. The more information you provide your market with, the less they'll have to contact you directly to resolve their queries or to answer their questions.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-15\\\">\\nBoring, formal, corporate language should be used internally (if that's your thing). Your customers are humans so treat them like humans by talking to them in clear and simple terms. Do not use obtuse lawyer-speak and don't drown people in industry-esoteric jargon. Be clear because the sooner you resolve the query, the sooner you can do something else or help someone else. You'll resolve the query sooner if everyone is on the same page. Here are <a href=\\\"http://www.flyingsolo.com.au/marketing/communication-skills/ten-tips-on-how-to-avoid-business-jargon\\\">10 tips<\\/a> on avoiding this type of bloated language.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-16\\\">\\nIf somebody asks a question that you don't know the answer to, do not wait to reply until you find the answer first. Let people know that their query is being attended to and keep them updated if it's going to take a while. People can be patient but the situation has to be reasonable, keep it reasonable by keeping them informed. You wouldn't leave your boss uninformed for days if her or she asked you to do something so remember to treat your clients with the same respect.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-17\\\">\\nAlways spend an extra minute or two to proofread your outgoing emails. Check for spelling, grammar and punctuation mistakes and always maintain a pleasant and welcoming tone. Use emoticons only when appropriate and not too often. If you need information from a person before you can resolve their query, make it very clear what you need or what they need to do. It goes without saying that you should never write in all-caps. You may want to consult this <a href=\\\"http://www.emailreplies.com/\\\">comprehensive list of email etiquette rules<\\/a>.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-18\\\">\\nIf your company has a system that allows people to provide feedback, stop and take some time to ensure that the feedback is being taken into consideration and isn't going to waste. If you cannot action that feedback then make sure that the person that can has seen it. Nothing will change if feedback is left collecting dust. Additionally, in order to optimize your feedback gathering strategy, you may want to know how to <a href=\\\"http://www.mycustomer.com/feature/experience/nine-steps-designing-voice-customer-programme/164790\\\">design a Voice of the Customer programme<\\/a>.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-19\\\">\\nTake some time to help mentor new colleagues and fellow staff members about the importance of service excellence. Teaching everyone in the company about being customer-centric is the only way to actually make your company be customer-centric. It doesn't have to be part of your job role to share insights with your colleagues on the company intranet or chatroom.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-20\\\">\\nEnsure that your company has laid out service standards that are measurable and specific enough to be able to fix when the standards are not being met. Be explicit with the actions that need to be taken to meet those standards and that they match the service qualities that your company values. The CEO should be the person outlining these standards or at least collaborating in defining them.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-21\\\">\\nYour company should reward great service both formally and informally. Service performance that gets rewarded formally as well as informally as part of the company culture (instead of a run-of-the-mill employee of the month) is what achieves great customer service. Keeping it fun will reinforce people's commitment and strategies like group leaderboards help catalyze a friendly competitive environment.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-22\\\">\\nAt times, the amount of available time you have may be very limited. When things are chaotic, you may feel that there are far more important things to do and that service must go on the back burner. Your customers never see it that way, to them good service should be your primary priority. If you want to convince your colleagues that they should see it as a priority, show them that you see it that way too and lead by example.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-23\\\">\\nIf you do not already do this then consider providing a way for your customers to give you feedback about your company and your services. You should also provide a way for your staff members or colleagues to record feedback about what the customers they speak to think is important.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-24\\\">\\nHave your company use tools that allow you to record feedback, deliver excellent customer support across whatever channels you support, and also make your company customer-centric. This may be one tool or a suite of tools but know that the customer support tools should not dictate how your company is structured. Your values come first and the tools and processes should follow. Use them in a way that allows you to be productive and capable of satisfying your customers.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-25\\\">\\nAsk and you'll probably receive. Getting feedback and getting your customers to write reviews about your brand requires you to ask them to do it. If you want enough reviews to have enough data to make real changes then actively drive your customers to write them. If your brand uses a <a href=\\\"http://mybema.com/\\\">preferred third party review platform<\\/a> then ask people to review your interactions, whether good or bad, after each of your support calls. It has been claimed that <a href=\\\"http://socialmediatoday.com/ubersocialmedia/2164961/improve-online-reviews-good-old-fashioned-customer-service\\\">positive reviews can increase sales by 58%<\\/a>.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-26\\\">\\nThe quicker you understand a customer's problem, the quicker you can help them resolve it. As obvious as it may seem, getting clarity about a situation isn't always as simple as it may seem. In order to avoid misunderstandings, first make sure that you understand the premise of a customer's argument and ensure that they understand the details needed to move forward, in the simplest way possible. Once every premise is clearly defined and understood by all parties, progress to a resolution will have fewer obstacles to overcome.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-27\\\">\\nEven though it may not strictly be part of your working agreement try to add a bit of additional effort and enthusiasm when dealing with people. People are great at picking up body language and they can easily pick up your positivity. This helps relieve some tension in unpleasant scenarios but also helps to concretize good experiences in the minds of your clients.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-28\\\">\\nService level agreements are often part of service contracts and are almost always a strong selling point. Upholding those SLAs is important if you want you customers to keep trusting you to deliver what you have promised. In order for that to happen the agreements need to be realistic and unambiguous. They should be clearly understood by your customers and all of your support staff should understand them and do everything possible to guarantee that they are fulfilled.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-29\\\">\\nA customer-centric philosophy is a good start in wanting to achieve a goal of delivering good customer service. In order for it to remain a constant there needs to be some leadership in the support team. Leaders need to be champions of amazing and consistent customer support and need to inspire everyone else in the team to imitate them. A lack of this type of role can lead to dwindling in motivation to continue to deliver. If there is no current leader, volunteer to step up, either formally or informally simply by sticking to the outlined philosophy and being vocal enough that your teammates join you.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-30\\\">\\nThe majority of support queries will relate to a small set of problems whose solutions are well documented but the odd curveball is inevitable. The support team should be able to have the power to attempt to resolve those issues without having to resort to a helping or permissive hand first. Every support member should be a problem solver and not a message conduit, as much as is possible. Product and process training is the best way to equip everyone on the frontline with enough knowledge to be able to at least confidently try to tackle every problem without having to resort to more senior staff or passing customers around.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-31\\\">\\nAt times, we're all guilty of not actively listening. Instead what we do is we begin formulating responses before the person we're listening to has even finished speaking. Mistakes like that mean that we sometimes miss out on important details which prevent us from resolving an issue the first time around because we'll have to backtrack at a later stage to recover those details. Good scientists collect as much data as they can and do not begin to analyze it until they're satisfied with the amount they have. Just as they listen to the data first, customer-facing agents should listen to queries before theorizing problems and considering solutions that may actually be time-costly.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-32\\\">\\nRapport is a great asset to have with repeat customers for many reasons, but it's useful for once-off callers as well. Rapport creates a bond, which opens up trust and better communication. People may reveal things if they trust you that they wouldn't otherwise and you never know how that may speed up your resolution process. Rapport takes some amount of social skill to be able to build up in a single conversation, but simple things like personalized [written] communication and using a person's name can be great catalysts. Here are some tips on <a href=\\\"http://www.callcentrehelper.com/27-effective-ways-to-build-customer-rapport-42018.htm\\\">effectively building up rapport<\\/a>.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-33\\\">\\nIt's not actually good enough to tell clients that you will get back to them later in the day or week. If you need to find something out and get back to a person, give yourself a deadline and let them know exactly when that deadline is. It's alright to email or to phone them up and let them know you're still working on it, but it's not alright to keep them in the dark. In fact it's more frustrating for them to wonder if you really will get back to them than you telling them you don't know how to deal with something and that you've had to pull in a colleague to help you.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-34\\\">\\nYour company may provide a service that's critical to the business of your clients, such as Internet connectivity or hosting, financial services or physical telecoms. When your products stop working for them then your company becomes the bottleneck in their workflow. Perhaps you can't anything to fix it directly but what you can do is facilitate the matter as one of urgency to ensure that those who can resolve it will resolve it. If the problem is one that blocks other work from happening, the manner in which you handle it for your client can be either a real feather in your cap or a black eye to your company's reputation.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-35\\\">\\nSpontaneously reward your customers with small gifts. Feature upgrades, data bundles, real-life gifts, and things of that sort go a long way in turning even your on-the-fence customers into raging brand ambassadors. Making your customers feel loved, coupled with great service will only help in decreasing your churn rate and increasing the lifetime value of your customers. The costs of the rewards become negligible in light of the elevated LTVs and referrals you'll get from the customers that love you most.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-36\\\">\\nThere is a lot to customer service and even more when it comes to amazing customer service. Even to veteran staff members who have gone through countless hours of training, more training is not a bad thing. Even the most experienced computer programmers spend time on tiny exercises coding away at the basic principles of programming. There is no doubt that they understand it but refinement is an ongoing process and the best programmers are the ones that practice their fundamental skills often. Having team discussions about customer service on a regular basis can bubble up hidden weaknesses, and having consultants from tangential fields and industries can always open up ideas that haven't been exposed before.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-37\\\">\\nSome of your staff will have more knowledge about specific things than others and a lot of this knowledge will be tacit. The best thing your company can do to try to keep everyone on the same level is to create a culture of sharing. Whether that is done via an internal tool like <a href=\\\"http://www.yammer.com\\\">Yammer<\\/a> or a wiki, it is important that it is done somehow. You may know something and assume that everyone else knows it too but there are a lot of seemingly obvious things that other people have never even heard of. Documentation is notoriously difficult to keep up-to-date but remember that many hands make light work. Share and collaborate to strengthen your team's knowledge.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-38\\\">\\nThe fact is that some people don't want to interact with other people to resolve an issue. <a href=\\\"http://www.economist.com/node/13961621\\\">Some studies<\\/a> even show that more people prefer self-help than dealing with another human. This insight means that self-help facilities are in demand. The first thing to do to set up a self-help culture around your product or service is to have documentation available. Make certain that there is plenty of up-to-date information available and accessible to people. Self-help facilities open up your staff to dealing with urgent queries. They also please customers that wouldn't want to deal with humans anyway. Self-help even allows people to help themselves in the middle of the night should they need to.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-39\\\">\\nSometimes frustrated people will lash out at you and be unreasonable. They may even be completely in the wrong. Despite this, you must remain empathetic. Try to uncover why they believe the incorrect facts that they do and help them understand things. Also help them prevent misunderstanding those facts in future. Empathy lets you to understand their vulnerable point of view and can prevent you from coming across as uncaring or defensive. Even if you cannot help them and they remain disappointed, they'll remember speaking to a human as opposed to a script reader.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-40\\\">\\nBeing able to improve requires being able to understand how you're currently performing. That can only be done through measurement. This may mean using tools or processes that allow you to track metrics such as the ratio of positive to negative feedback, time to first response, time to resolution, and ratio of issues successfully resolved to those left unresolved. Do not start tracking everything if you don't track anything yet or you'll begin to feel overwhelmed very quickly. Track a few things, preferably the metrics around customer satisfaction and service quality levels, and add new metrics as they're required.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-41\\\">\\nUnderstanding the demographics and general details of your consumer base and target market will allow you to structure how you market and respond to them. Knowing this will also mean being able to write content that your audience understands right off the bat. A bank wouldn't refer to their clients as dudes, but your business may very well do so. Context is important, and if you know what type of communication your market is comfortable with, you will increase your conversion and retention rates.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-42\\\">\\nHaving to deal with a customer more than once about the same issue will no doubt be frustrating to that person. It will also become frustrating to you, the agent dealing with the issue. The longer a problem goes unresolved, the less motivated a representative will be to resolve it. This is because it means dealing with an ever more frustrated person that may be prone to being abusive. Being able to fix something within the first one or two interactions means retaining a high satisfaction rate for both the representative and the customer. A first call resolution rate of less than 100% means that there are some customers that your team are frustrating and turning into flight risks.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-43\\\">\\nAs well as you may currently be doing your job, there will be ways that you can improve. Asking colleagues for feedback is as valuable as asking for feedback from customers after you satisfy their request. The level of service cannot remain static or it will erode as time goes by. Continuous service improvement is a must if delivery levels are to remain high.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-44\\\">\\nTo say that you're going to under promise and over deliver is a bit of a clich&eacute;, but it's a clich&eacute; for a reason. Under-promising within reason gives you a bit of leeway with which to complete a task. So it's better to promise to do what is requested of you (in a reasonable amount of time) and then throw in a little extra wherever you can. You may not always be able to over-deliver, but make sure to never under-deliver.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-45\\\">\\nIt's important to get feedback from your company's staff as well as your customers' perceptions of the levels of customer service. According to IBM, <a href=\\\"http://www.ibm.com/big-data/us/en/big-data-and-analytics/marketing.html\\\">80% of CEOs think they deliver superior experience<\\/a> whereas only 8% of their customers agreed with them. That is a massive discrepancy in opinion and you should keep it in check as time goes by. Achieve this by doing surveys frequently enough to prevent the opinions of executives from living in a vacuum. If the executive team thinks that service levels are amazing, there is less incentive for them to take corrective measures or improve the levels of service in reality.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-46\\\">\\nIf your company has enough time and resources to do so then it should try to follow up with customers that have had issues. Following up is a great way of impressing customers. Once someone in your team resolves an issue or answers a query, the next step is to show that customer that they weren't just a number in the queue. You can achieve this via a quick phone call or email (after some period of time) asking if everything is working as should be. Couple that with a prompt for some feedback of quality, and you can go a long way toward building a relationship.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-47\\\">\\nSome clients will seem like thorns in your side no matter how hard you try, but that doesn't mean that trying is futile. It's worth remembering that a person with enough conviction to be unhappy with you has enough emotional capacity to love your company. That is, once they're finally won over again. Unhappy customers hold vital insights into some of the things you're doing wrong as a team. That's information that you can use to fix your process before more new customers turn unhappy.\\n<\\/p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"customer-service-action-header\\\" id=\\\"header-48\\\">\\nTwo-way communication <i class=\\\"icon-ok dismissable\\\" id=\\\"dismiss-icon-48\\\"><\\/i>\\n<\\/h2>\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-48\\\">\\nYou may often need a customer to furnish you with enough information to be able to help them. Likewise, you too must keep the customer in the loop about what it is you're actually doing to help them. If you're helping someone by means of a telephone call then let him or her know why it is you'll be putting them on hold. Tell your customer the reasons for why you have to grill them with several questions, instead of leaving them to feel like you're interrogating them.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-49\\\">\\nWhen helping someone that has few remaining options available to them, steer clear of reminding them of what they cannot do to resolve their issue. Before contacting you they've probably asked someone or read up on what can or cannot be done. Guide them by listing all the options you know that they will have available to them. Advise them and genuinely try to help them out as best as you can. Nobody likes being told that they have no options available to them.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-50\\\">\\nEven if your process seems to be loved by your users or customers, it could be even better. The only way to know for sure is to test different approaches. The service team should periodically introduce different approaches, no matter how small, and try those approaches out on different segments. This sort of split testing will reveal which approaches yield the best results, allowing you to change them, or improve confidence levels that the current approach is the best possible one. Be sure to test one thing at a time in order to keep the results clean.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-51\\\">\\nFocusing on retaining your existing client base is one of the best things you can do in terms of service and revenue flow. It is significantly cheaper and easier to keep existing customers happy than it is to find new ones and then trying to convert them into customers. You'll have to then impress those new customers enough in order to make them love you, stay with you and tell their friends about you. Spending time keeping your current customers happy is a step in securing them as future customers, which is essentially free revenue. You may be interested in these <a href=\\\"http://www.rocketwatcher.com/blog/2010/05/top-5-customer-retention-marketingtactics.html\\\">retention marketing tactics<\\/a>.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-52\\\">\\nIf you have a page on your website where users can fill in a form to contact you, or can chat to you directly via a widget, be sure to track those activities. If you set up event tracking with tools like <a href=\\\"http://www.kissmetrics.com\\\">Kissmetrics<\\/a> then with enough time and data you'll be able to measure if you have a high contact form abandonment rate. If there are people that want to contact you but never actually fill out of submit the form, you're losing out on feedback and potentially even customers. You need to fix problems like this, and the best way to get started is by setting up tracking so that your decisions can be data-driven.\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p id=\\\"paragraph-53\\\">\\nIt may be tempting to upsell to a person after having successfully helped them with a problem, but upselling should be used with caution. You can very easily destroy the rapport you've just built up with someone if you come off as too aggressive in your upselling pitch which can undo your work. Having long term clients is better than some short-term padding on your sales sheet.\\n<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<div class=\\\"mybema_insights_hero_text\\\">\\n<div>\\nThere's a lot to remember here so bookmark this page and focus on roughly 4 points every week.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://kristinn.ghost.io/favicon.ico\",\"text\":\"What should I do tonight?\\nI think I will spend some time starting up my own little framework of bits and pieces I repeatedly do when coding my own little projects. I might call it \\\"k-frame\\\". Who knows how far I will get with it. I might finish setting up that virtual linux machine, as I got rid of my linux partition when I installed that SSD. After spending an hour or two coding away I might just pop into some computer game and relax.\\nI think I will chill.\\nA few years ago I wanted to know everything. I spent the day at work thinking about what I would do when I got home and then spend the evening studying various things as hard as I could. I would stress over how there werent enought hours in the day to do what I wanted to do. There was rarely an hour in the day where I wasnt productive in some way.\\nI was becoming a stessed out, neurotic individual.\\nThe topic of burnout rarely comes up in dev circles. It seems to be a dirty word. If you burn out you just couldnt hack it. You should have streamline your workflow. There is huge pressure to learn and produce. But few talk about it. It happens to everyone, why would we be any different.\\nI got very close to burning out when I was in school juggling being in a band, studying for my bachelors degree and trying to develop my professional skills at home. I didnt let myself be a band guy, nor a coding guy or even just a student. I wanted to be all at once. This couldnt last.

I spent the day at work thinking about what I would do when I got home and then spend the evening studying various things as hard as I could.

I didnt let myself be a band guy, nor a coding guy or even just a student. I wanted to be all at once. This couldnt last. After I graduated I took a little time away from it all and focused on what I wanted. I wanted to be a coder. So I reduced the time I would spend on my guitar stuff to do more programming.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/touch_icon_152.png?m=1391240679g\",\"author\":\"John Arlidge\",\"text\":\"We use Jonathan Ive\\u2019s products to help us to eat, drink and sleep, to work, travel, relax, read, listen and watch, to shop, chat, date and have sex. Many of us spend more time with his screens than with our families. Some of us like his screens more than our families. For years, Ive\\u2019s natural shyness, coupled with the secrecy bordering on paranoia of his employer, Apple, has meant we have known little about the man who shapes the future, with such innovations as the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. But last month, he invited me to Cupertino in Silicon Valley where Apple is based, for his first in-depth interview since he became head of design almost 20 years ago.\\nThe gods \\u2014 or was it the ghost of Steve Jobs? \\u2014 seemed against it. Jobs didn\\u2019t like Apple execs doing interviews. It had not rained properly in California for months but that morning the clouds rolled off the Pacific, turning the Golden Gate Bridge black. Interstate 280 South to Silicon Valley was a river of water, instead of the usual lava streaks of stop-start SUVs. But just after 10AM, an Apple tech-head appeared in an all-white meeting room on the first floor of building 4 of the firm\\u2019s antiseptic headquarters with strict instructions to find an Earl Grey tea bag.\\n\\u201cHello. Thanks for coming,\\u201d grins Ive, as he rolls in, picking up his brew. Ive is the most unremarkable remarkable person you could meet. You might think you\\u2019d recognize him if you passed him on the street, but you wouldn\\u2019t. He\\u2019s not particularly tall, is well built and bald(ish), has two-day-old stubble and dresses like dads do on weekends \\u2014 navy polo shirt, canvas trousers, desert boots. He speaks slowly and softly in an Essex accent totally unaffected by living in America for more than two decades. \\u201cI can\\u2019t even bring myself to say math, instead of maths, so I say mathematics. I sound ridiculous,\\u201d he laughs.\\nIve is in a good mood today \\u2014 and not just because he\\u2019s celebrating his 47th birthday. He likes the idea of this interview series because he sees himself as more of a maker than a designer. \\u201cObjects and their manufacture are inseparable. You understand a product if you understand how it\\u2019s made,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI want to know what things are for, how they work, what they can or should be made of, before I even begin to think what they should look like. More and more people do. There is a resurgence of the idea of craft.\\u201d\\nIve has been a maker ever since he could wield a screwdriver. He inherited his craftsman\\u2019s skills from his father, Michael. He was a silversmith who later became a lecturer in craft, design and technology at Middlesex Polytechnic. Ive spent his childhood taking apart the family\\u2019s worldly goods and trying to put them back together again. \\u201cComplete intrigue with the physical world starts by destroying it,\\u201d he says. Radios were easy, but \\u201cI remember taking an alarm clock to pieces and it was very difficult to reassemble it. I couldn\\u2019t get the mainspring rewound.\\u201d Thirty years later, he did the same to his iPhone one day. Just to prove he still could.\\n\\u201cI want to know what things are for, how they work, what they can or should be made of, before I even begin to think what they should look like\\u201d A love of making is something he shared with Jobs, Apple\\u2019s former chief executive who died three years ago. It helped the two men forge the most creative partnership modern capitalism has seen. In less than two decades, they transformed Apple from a near-bankrupt also-ran into the most valuable corporation on the planet, worth more than $665 billion.\\n\\u201cSteve and I spent months and months working on a part of a product that, often, nobody would ever see, nor realize was there,\\u201d Ive grins. Apple is notorious for making the insides of its machines look as good as the outside. \\u201cIt didn\\u2019t make any difference functionally. We did it because we cared, because when you realize how well you can make something, falling short, whether seen or not, feels like failure.\\u201d\\nFor a man whose products are all called iSomething, it\\u2019s surprising that \\u201ci\\u201d is one word Ive scarcely uses. He talks constantly about his team or Jobs, using \\u201cwe.\\u201d This is not \\u201caw-shucks\\u201d false modesty or corporate-speak. \\u201cI don\\u2019t like being singled out for attention. Designing, engineering and making these products requires large teams,\\u201d he says.\\nIve really does keep a low profile \\u2014 or at least as low a profile as you\\u2019d expect one of the world\\u2019s most highly paid designers to keep. He has only one house \\u2014 in the swanky Pacific Heights district of San Francisco, where his neighbors include Oracle\\u2019s Larry Ellison, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and actor Nicolas Cage. He lives there with his British wife, Heather Pegg, a writer and historian, and their twin sons. He avoids publicity. He and his design team have only been seen in public once: in London two years ago when they all turned up to accept a prestigious D&AD design award.\\nThe simple truth is, Ive hates fuss and relishes simplicity. You can see that from his products. They may be revolutionary, high-tech magic boxes, but they look so elegantly simple that you know what they are for and how to use them the moment you first pick them up. The iMac banished complicated, hard-to-use PCs from our desks and made computing easy. With just a tiny white box with a scroll wheel, he put 1,000 songs in our pocket. The iPhone was so touchy-feely, it trashed the fiddly Blackberry in a heartbeat. Five-year-old kids can pick up and use the iPad.\\nHis love of simplicity and directness extends beyond tech. He collects point\\u2019n\\u2019shoot cars \\u2014 the kind that are hewn from a single block of aluminum. He has a few Bentleys and a natty 1960s Aston Martin DB4 in a silvery blue. It was his teenage love of cars that made Ive decide to become a designer. When he left school, he checked out a few car-design courses in London, including one at the Royal College. He swiftly changed his mind. \\u201cThe classes were full of students making vroom! vroom! noises as they drew,\\u201d he recalls, still horrified. So he headed to Newcastle Polytechnic to study industrial design. His work there \\u2014 notably a telephone and a hearing aid \\u2014 was so good it was exhibited at the Design Museum in London.\\nAfter leaving Newcastle, he went to work for Roberts Weaver group, the London design agency that had sponsored him through college. He left a year later to join Tangerine, a new design agency in the capital\\u2019s Hoxton Square. (He obviously has a thing about firms named after fruit.) There, he designed everything from microwave ovens to toothbrushes. But he quickly became disillusioned working for clients he didn\\u2019t like or whose values he didn\\u2019t share. The final straw came one rainy day when he drove to Hull to present his design for a new hand basin and toilet for ideal Standard. It was the BBC\\u2019s Comic Relief Day and the boss lampooned his work as too modern and too expensive to build \\u2014 while wearing a giant plastic red nose.\\nBut there was one Tangerine client Ive admired: Apple, for which he had started working as a consultant. He came up with the early designs for a portable computer that became the Powerbook in 1991. He had first come across Apple after \\u201chaving such problems with computers\\u201d during his student years that he feared he was \\u201ctechnically inept.\\u201d Apple\\u2019s intuitive mouse-driven system suddenly made it all seem so simple. The company had been asking him to work full-time for two years, but he had hesitated. Apple was in trouble at the time and the firm was half a world away. This time he signed up. It was 1992.\\nHis first few years were frustrating. Back then, Apple\\u2019s products were dull. Remember the Newton? Thought not. Design didn\\u2019t matter much. He almost quit several times. But when Steve Jobs, who had been ousted in 1985, returned to try to save the firm in 1996, he spotted Ive\\u2019s talent and the two men set out on their maniacal journey to remake what they saw as the bland, lazy world around them. Or at least the bits of it they thought they could change. Unlike other electronics giants that make everything from computers to cameras to fridges, Apple makes and has only ever made three things: computers, entertainment devices and phones.\\nIve works in a design studio in a building on one corner of Apple\\u2019s campus at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, the firm\\u2019s address. It looks like all the other dull, un-Apple-like glass and beige \\u2014 yes, beige \\u2014 concrete blocks. With one really big difference. The glass is opaque and no-one other than Ive, his core team and top Apple executives is allowed in. \\u201cThe reason is, it\\u2019s the one place you can go and see everything we\\u2019re working on \\u2014 all the designs, all the prototypes,\\u201d Ive says.\\nHis team, from Britain, America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, \\u201cis really much smaller than you\\u2019d think \\u2014 about 15. Most of us have worked together for 15 to 20 years.\\u201d That\\u2019s useful. \\u201cWe can be bitterly critical of our work. The personal issues of ego have long since faded.\\u201d The large open-plan studio is, like most of Ive\\u2019s personal Apple products, all-white. A large wooden bench, like the Genius Bars in Apple Stores, is devoted to new products. At one end are a lot of CNCS \\u2014 high-tech machines that are used to make prototypes. \\u201cEveryone I work with shares the same love of and respect for making,\\u201d he says.\\nIve starts a project by imagining what a new kind of product should be and what it should do. Only once he\\u2019s answered those questions does he work out what it should look like. He seeks advice in unlikely places. He worked with confectionery manufacturers to perfect the translucent jelly-bean shades of his first big hit, the original iMac. He travelled to Niigata in northern Japan to see how metalworkers there beat metal thin, to help him create the titanium Powerbook, the first lightweight aluminum laptop in a world of hefty black plastic slabs.\\nHe spent \\u201cmonths and months and months\\u201d working out the exact shape of the stand of the desktop iMac computer because \\u201cit\\u2019s very hard to design something that you almost do not see because it just seems so obvious, natural and inevitable\\u201d. When he has finished a product, even one as fresh and iconic as the white headphones that came with the first iPod, he is haunted by the idea: could I have done it better? \\u201cIt\\u2019s an affliction designers are cursed with,\\u201d Ive frowns.\\nIt was an affliction he shared with Jobs, although he seemed to apply it to everything, with \\u2014 almost \\u2014 funny consequences. Ive recalls traveling with Jobs. \\u201cWe\\u2019d get to the hotel where we were going, we\\u2019d check in and I\\u2019d go up to my room. I\\u2019d leave my bags by the door. I wouldn\\u2019t unpack. I\\u2019d go and sit on the bed and wait for the inevitable call from Steve: \\u2018Hey Jony, this hotel sucks. let\\u2019s go.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nJobs\\u2019 presence still looms large at Apple. Outside the room where Ive and I meet is one of his sayings printed in huge letters on the wall. It reads: \\u201cIf you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what\\u2019s next.\\u201d What made the two men work so well together? After all, they are very different. Ive has a gentle, easy-going manner. The laser-sharp intensity of his ideas is leavened by warmth and humor, much of it self-deprecating. No one ever described Jobs as easygoing or self-deprecating. \\u201cWhen we were looking at objects, what our eyes physically saw and what we came to perceive were exactly the same. And we would ask the same questions, have the same curiosity about things.\\u201d\\nWas Jobs as tough as people say? Stories abound of him humiliating underlings and even \\u2014 perhaps especially \\u2014 top executives. \\u201cSo much has been written about Steve, and I don\\u2019t recognize my friend in much of it. Yes, he had a surgically precise opinion. Yes, it could sting. Yes, he constantly questioned. \\u2018Is this good enough? Is this right?\\u2019 but he was so clever. His ideas were bold and magnificent. They could suck the air from the room. And when the ideas didn\\u2019t come, he decided to believe we would eventually make something great. And, oh, the joy of getting there!\\u201d\\nFor such a determined maker, you might think that Ive would single out a product, probably the iPhone, as his greatest achievement. It is certainly the most copied invention of the modern era. But it is an idea he likes most. He and his team have, he says, proved that consumers are not the price-obsessed philistines they are often assumed to be.\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re surrounded by anonymous, poorly made objects. It\\u2019s tempting to think it\\u2019s because the people who use them don\\u2019t care \\u2014 just like the people who make them. But what we\\u2019ve shown is that people do care. It\\u2019s not just about aesthetics. They care about things that are thoughtfully conceived and well made. We make and sell a very, very large number of (hopefully) beautiful, well-made things. our success is a victory for purity, integrity \\u2014 for giving a damn.\\u201d\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not just about aesthetics. Our success is a victory for purity, integrity \\u2014 for giving a damn\\u201dPerhaps. But critics complain about the built-in obsolescence of Apple products, its hermetically sealed operating systems, the need to buy new chargers for new products and the prices it charges. Oh, the prices! $20 for a plastic charger that probably costs less than $2 to make! Chargers and iOS are matters for Apple\\u2019s software fellas and the firm\\u2019s new boss, Tim Cook. When it comes to obsolescence, Ive himself concedes he is carrying the fifth version of a phone that was only invented in 2007, with, yes, a new charger. But, he says: \\u201cOne of the things that is distinct about our products is that they get reused and passed on.\\u201d What do you do with your old iPhones? \\u201cErm. Actually, they\\u2019re not mine. They\\u2019re the company\\u2019s.\\u201d What does the company do with them? \\u201cWe reuse stuff and then we\\u2019ll disassemble stuff and recycle stuff. I understand what\\u2019s behind the question, but I think it\\u2019s a fundamental \\u2014 and good \\u2014 part of the human condition to try to make things better. That\\u2019s the role we\\u2019re playing.\\u201d\\nOn price, Ive points out that developing life-changing products that we could not have imagined before but when we see them we want at once, is very expensive. What\\u2019s more, manufacturing them the Apple way, often to tolerances far higher than needed, costs a bomb. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons. Quite the reverse,\\u201d he laughs. Ive picks up his iPhone to demonstrate how technically complex its construction is. \\u201cThe body is made from a single piece of machined aluminium,\\u201d he says, sticking to the British pronunciation Jobs used to tease him about. \\u201cThe whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters. The cutters don\\u2019t usually last very long, so we had to figure out a way of mass-manufacturing long-lasting ones. The camera cover is sapphire crystal. Look at the details around the sim-card slot. It\\u2019s extraordinary!\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty, all right, and doubtless costs a pretty penny to make. But there\\u2019s something else at play, something Ive won\\u2019t say. As long as Apple keeps on making such wildly innovative products \\u2014 no other manufacturer, not even Apple\\u2019s arch-rival Samsung, has even come close to beating the iPad, and not for want of trying \\u2014 Apple can charge whatever it likes and consumers will pony up. Apple sells about 250m iPhones, iPads and Macs a year and, since its launch, customers have downloaded more than 25 billion songs and 1 billion TV episodes from the iTunes Store \\u2014 all with margins that make its competitors weep.\\nIve talks so much more about making things than designing them, it seems odd that he has chosen to work in tech, where so much of the magic is in the software, not the hardware. You can\\u2019t touch tech. There are no wheels or moving parts in an iPad or an iPhone. Ive says tech products offer something unique \\u2014 and uniquely challenging. \\u201cThe product you have in your hand, or put into your ear, or have in your pocket, is more personal than the product you have on your desk. The struggle to make something as difficult and demanding as technology so intimately personal is what first attracted me to Apple. People have an incredibly personal relationship with what we make.\\u201d\\nThat relationship is getting closer all the time. The new big thing is wearable tech. Google has brought out web-enabled Google Glass spectacles. Samsung and Sony have introduced web-linked smartwatches. Will Apple make an iWatch? \\u201cObviously, there are rumors about us working on\\u2026 and, obviously, I\\u2019m not going to talk about that. It\\u2019s a game of chess, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d Sounds like the Jaeger-LeCoultre sports watch he\\u2019s wearing is not long for his wrist \\u2014 even though he designed it himself for an AIDS-charity auction and it is only one of three in the world.\\nThat\\u2019s the trouble with tech. It changes so quickly. Just when you think you have the best gadget, something newer, cooler, comes along \\u2014 usually something made by Ive. Not that Apple\\u2019s hundreds of millions of fans care. The newer it is, the more they like it. But should they? When Ive sees customers queueing overnight to buy the latest iPhone, does he worry that we have become too obsessed with the latest \\u201cthis\\u201d or \\u201cthat\\u201d, that we are genuflecting at the altar of technology? A phone is just a phone, not the second coming of Christ. \\u201cWhat people are responding to is much bigger than the object. They are responding to something rare \\u2014 a group of people who do more than simply make something work, they make the very best products they possibly can. It\\u2019s a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness,\\u201d he says.\\nIt\\u2019s the first time in more than an hour and a half that Ive allows himself to be a little grand. Beneath his studiously modest public demeanor lies a heart of solid steel \\u2014 ok, aluminum. He\\u2019d have to have terabytes of confidence and resolve to win the battles that Jobs deliberately fostered between senior executives in a brutally Darwinian effort to get the best from each of them.\\nI hear it again when I ask whether he is flattered or frustrated when he sees his designs so widely referenced, reworked \\u2014 ok, copied. \\u201cIt\\u2019s theft,\\u201d he replies in a heartbeat, his eyes narrowing sharply. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s copied isn\\u2019t just a design, it\\u2019s thousands and thousands of hours of struggle. It\\u2019s only when you\\u2019ve achieved what you set out to do that you can say, \\u2018This was worth pursuing.\\u2019 It takes years of investment, years of pain.\\u201d Jobs put Ive\\u2019s anger into action. He severed ties with the Google boss and former Apple board member Eric Schmidt, when it emerged the search giant was developing its own answer to the iPhone. Jobs also successfully sued Samsung for $1 billion for ripping off Apple\\u2019s ideas.\\n\\u201cYes, Steve Jobs had a surgically precise opinion. Yes, it could sting. But his ideas were so bold and magnificent. They could suck the air from the room\\u201dIve describes Jobs as \\u201cmy closest friend\\u201d and says he finds it \\u201codd and tough to talk about him, because it doesn\\u2019t feel that long ago that he died.\\u201d There is, perhaps, another reason. Since Jobs died, Apple has hit a rough patch, at least by its ludicrously high standards. It has not had a break-out hit. There has been no Apple TV set to revolutionize home entertainment. No spiffy watch. (Yet.) The firm\\u2019s share price has slumped and it has lost its title of the world\\u2019s most valuable firm. Some speculate that, without Jobs, Apple has lost its golden touch. An acclaimed new book by the former Wall Street Journal technology writer Yukari Iwatani Kane dubs the company \\u201cthe haunted empire.\\u201d Others say it has killed its own future: that by creating so many extraordinary products in such a short time, it has run out of things to invent.\\nIf that were true, if Apple could no longer make stuff that shreds, not pushes, the envelope, would Ive give up? \\u201cYes. I\\u2019d stop. I\\u2019d make things for myself, for my friends at home instead. The bar needs to be high.\\u201d But, he adds: \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that will happen. We are at the beginning of a remarkable time, when a remarkable number of products will be developed. When you think about technology and what it has enabled us to do so far, and what it will enable us to do in future, we\\u2019re not even close to any kind of limit. It\\u2019s still so, so new.\\u201d\\nWhat\\u2019s more, after all the years of toil, all the gazillions he\\u2019s made, he\\u2019s still remarkably hungry. \\u201cAt Apple, there\\u2019s almost a joy in looking at your ignorance and realizing, \\u2018Wow, we\\u2019re going to learn about this and, by the time we\\u2019re done, we\\u2019re going to really understand and do something great.\\u2019 Apple is imperfect, like every large collection of people. But we have a rare quality. There is this almost pre-verbal, instinctive understanding about what we do, why we do it. We share the same values.\\u201d\\nSo the best of Jony Ive, the best of Apple, is still to come? \\u201cI hope so.\\u201d And, with that, he gulps down the last of his now-cold Earl Grey and heads back through the warm California rain to his secret lab. Tomorrow doesn\\u2019t wait for the man who designs it.\\nJohn Arlidge writes for the Sunday Times Magazine. His story on Goldman Sachs, in which Lloyd Blankfein, the investment bank\\u2019s chief executive, said bankers \\u201cdo God\\u2019s work\\u201d, is the most quoted article of the financial crisis.

Many of us spend more time with his screens than with our families. Some of us like his screens <em>more<\\/em> than our families. For years, Ive&rsquo;s natural shyness, coupled with the secrecy bordering on paranoia of his employer, Apple, has meant we have known little about the man who shapes the future, with such innovations as the <a href=\\\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20020114,00.html\\\">iMac<\\/a>, the <a href=\\\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20051024,00.html\\\">iPod<\\/a>, the <a href=\\\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20071112,00.html\\\">iPhone<\\/a> and the <a href=\\\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20100412,00.html\\\">iPad<\\/a>. But last month, he invited me to Cupertino in Silicon Valley where Apple is based, for his first in-depth interview since he became head of design almost 20 years ago. <\\/span><\\/p>\\n<p><span style=\\\"line-height:1.5em;\\\">The gods &mdash; or was it the ghost of Steve Jobs? &mdash; seemed against it. Jobs <a href=\\\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-extreme-examples-of-secrecy-at-apple-2013-7?op=1\\\">didn&rsquo;t like<\\/a> Apple execs doing interviews. <\\/span><span style=\\\"line-height:1.5em;\\\">It had not rained properly in California for months but that morning the clouds rolled off the Pacific, <\\/span>turning the Golden Gate Bridge black. Interstate 280 South to Silicon Valley was a river of water, instead of the usual lava streaks of stop-start SUVs. But just after 10AM, an Apple tech-head appeared in an all-white meeting room on the first floor of building 4 of the firm&rsquo;s antiseptic headquarters with strict instructions to find an Earl Grey tea bag.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;Hello. Thanks for coming,&rdquo; grins Ive, as he rolls in, picking up his brew. Ive is the most unremarkable remarkable person you could meet. You might think you&rsquo;d recognize him if you passed him on the street, but you wouldn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s not particularly tall, is well built and bald(ish), has two-day-old stubble and dresses like dads do on weekends &mdash; navy polo shirt, canvas trousers, desert boots. He speaks slowly and softly in an Essex accent totally unaffected by living in America for more than two decades. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even bring myself to say math, instead of maths, so I say mathematics. I sound ridiculous,&rdquo; he laughs.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"special-article-ad special-article-ad-small alignright\\\" data-pos=\\\"0\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" id=\\\"special-article-24909-0\\\"><\\/div>\\n<p>Ive is in a good mood today &mdash; and not just because he&rsquo;s celebrating his 47th birthday. He likes the idea of this interview series because he sees himself as more of a maker than a designer. &ldquo;Objects and their manufacture are inseparable. You understand a product if you understand how it&rsquo;s made,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I want to know what things are for, how they work, what they can or should be made of, before I even begin to think what they should look like. More and more people do. There is a resurgence of the idea of craft.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>Ive has been a maker ever since he could wield a screwdriver. He inherited his craftsman&rsquo;s skills from his father, Michael. He was a silversmith who later became a lecturer in craft, design and technology at Middlesex Polytechnic. Ive spent his childhood taking apart the family&rsquo;s worldly goods and trying to put them back together again. &ldquo;Complete intrigue with the physical world starts by destroying it,&rdquo; he says. Radios were easy, but &ldquo;I remember taking an alarm clock to pieces and it was very difficult to reassemble it. I couldn&rsquo;t get the mainspring rewound.&rdquo; Thirty years later, he did the same to his iPhone one day. Just to prove he still could.<\\/p>\\n<p><span class=\\\"pullquote\\\">&ldquo;I want to know what things are for, how they work, what they can or should be made of, before I even begin to think what they should look like&rdquo;<\\/span> A love of making is something he shared with Jobs, <a href=\\\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20111017,00.html\\\">Apple&rsquo;s former chief executive<\\/a> who died three years ago. It helped the two men forge the most creative partnership modern capitalism has seen. In less than two decades, they transformed Apple from a near-bankrupt also-ran into the most valuable corporation on the planet, worth more than $665 billion.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;Steve and I spent months and months working on a part of a product that, often, nobody would ever see, nor realize was there,&rdquo; Ive grins. Apple is notorious for making the insides of its machines look as good as the outside. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t make any difference functionally. We did it because we cared, because when you realize how well you can make something, falling short, whether seen or not, feels like failure.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>For a man whose products are all called iSomething, it&rsquo;s surprising that &ldquo;i&rdquo; is one word Ive scarcely uses. He talks constantly about his team or Jobs, using &ldquo;we.&rdquo; This is not &ldquo;aw-shucks&rdquo; false modesty or corporate-speak. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like being singled out for attention. Designing, engineering and making these products requires large teams,&rdquo; he says.<\\/p>\\n<p>Ive really does keep a low profile &mdash; or at least as low a profile as you&rsquo;d expect one of the world&rsquo;s most highly paid designers to keep. He has only one house &mdash; in the swanky Pacific Heights district of San Francisco, where his neighbors include Oracle&rsquo;s Larry Ellison, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel and actor Nicolas Cage. He lives there with his British wife, Heather Pegg, a writer and historian, and their twin sons. He avoids publicity. He and his design team have only been seen in public once: in London two years ago when they all turned up to accept a prestigious <a href=\\\"https://www.dandad.org/\\\">D&amp;AD design award<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"image-wrapper special-medium alignleft\\\">\\n<figure class=\\\"inline-special_medium\\\"><img alt=\\\"Apple's 2001 iPod\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" src=\\\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/apple-ipod-2001-mac-1.jpg?w=380\\\"><\\/img><br>\\n\\n<\\/figure>\\n<\\/div>\\n<p>The simple truth is, Ive hates fuss and relishes simplicity. You can see that from his products. They may be revolutionary, high-tech magic boxes, but they look so elegantly simple that you know what they are for and how to use them the moment you first pick them up. The iMac banished complicated, hard-to-use PCs from our desks and made computing easy. With just a tiny white box with a scroll wheel, he put 1,000 songs in our pocket. The iPhone was so touchy-feely, it <a href=\\\"http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/30/rim-2/\\\">trashed the fiddly Blackberry<\\/a> in a heartbeat. Five-year-old kids can pick up and use the iPad.<\\/p>\\n<p>His love of simplicity and directness extends beyond tech. He collects point&rsquo;n&rsquo;shoot cars &mdash; the kind that are hewn from a single block of aluminum. He has a few Bentleys and a natty <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/search?q=1960s+Aston+Martin+DB4&espv=210&es_sm=91&tbm=isch&imgil=mTTqmNJEak7KpM%253A%253Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fencrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com%252Fimages%253Fq%253Dtbn%253AANd9GcSLniAG7LQ5IBYx5bwA2SCGNTPWdbhJkEyJXY93fN1DGqJ3f4yQ4w%253B1024%253B683%253BH4BleVTx6YvGgM%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.supercars.net%25252FPics%25253FviewCarPic%2525253Dy%25252526source%2525253DcarGal%25252526carID%2525253D2086%25252526pgID%2525253D1%25252526pID%2525253D643959&source=iu&usg=__xjzDXxrTgIwPPDYndnGSTByYGeM%3D&sa=X&ei=3oIkU9ToAsmT0QH2oYHIBg&ved=0CDIQ9QEwAw#q=1960s+Aston+Martin+DB4+blue&tbm=isch&imgdii=_\\\">1960s Aston Martin DB4<\\/a> in a silvery blue. It was his teenage love of cars that made Ive decide to become a designer. When he left school, he checked out a few car-design courses in London, including one at the Royal College. He swiftly changed his mind. &ldquo;The classes were full of students making vroom! vroom! noises as they drew,&rdquo; he recalls, still horrified. So he headed to Newcastle Polytechnic to study industrial design. His work there &mdash; notably a telephone and a hearing aid &mdash; was so good it was exhibited at the <a href=\\\"http://designmuseum.org/\\\">Design Museum<\\/a> in London.<\\/p>\\n<p>After leaving Newcastle, he went to work for Roberts Weaver group, the London design agency that had sponsored him through college. He left a year later to join Tangerine, a new design agency in the capital&rsquo;s Hoxton Square. (He obviously has a thing about firms named after fruit.) There, he designed everything from microwave ovens to toothbrushes. But he quickly became disillusioned working for clients he didn&rsquo;t like or whose values he didn&rsquo;t share. The final straw came one rainy day when he drove to Hull to present his design for a new hand basin and toilet for ideal Standard. It was the BBC&rsquo;s <a href=\\\"http://www.rednoseday.com/\\\">Comic Relief Day<\\/a> and the boss lampooned his work as too modern and too expensive to build &mdash; while wearing a giant plastic red nose.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<\\/section>\\n\\t\\t\\t<section class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n<p>But there was one Tangerine client Ive admired: Apple, for which he had started working as a consultant. He came up with the early designs for a portable computer that became the <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5HMkCqfhCA\\\">Powerbook in 1991<\\/a>. He had first come across Apple after &ldquo;having such problems with computers&rdquo; during his student years that he feared he was &ldquo;technically inept.&rdquo; Apple&rsquo;s intuitive mouse-driven system suddenly made it all seem so simple. The company had been asking him to work full-time for two years, but he had hesitated. Apple was in trouble at the time and the firm was half a world away. This time he signed up. It was 1992.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"media-wrapper\\\">\\n<div class=\\\"video-wrapper\\\" data-pos=\\\"1\\\"><object class=\\\"BrightcoveExperience\\\" id=\\\"bc-video-3349963583001-1\\\"><param name=\\\"bgcolor\\\" value=\\\"#000000\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"width\\\" value=\\\"100%\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"height\\\" value=\\\"100%\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"playerID\\\" value=\\\"1847503743001\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"playerKey\\\" value=\\\"AQ~,AAAAABGEUMg,hNlIXLTZFZkptbFZWyhVNa2P0Pl5hvzc\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"isVid\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"isUI\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"videoSmoothing\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"dynamicStreaming\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"autoStart\\\" value=\\\"false\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"@videoPlayer\\\" value=\\\"3349963583001\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"linkBaseURL\\\" value=\\\"http://ti.me/1iJEk2U\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"includeAPI\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"templateLoadHandler\\\" value=\\\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"templateReadyHandler\\\" value=\\\"TIME_onTemplateReady\\\"><\\/param><param name=\\\"wmode\\\" value=\\\"opaque\\\"><\\/param><\\/object><\\/div>\\n<\\/div>\\n<div class=\\\"special-article-ad special-article-ad-small alignright\\\" data-pos=\\\"1\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" id=\\\"special-article-24909-1\\\"><\\/div>\\n<p>His first few years were frustrating. Back then, <a href=\\\"http://money.cnn.com/gallery/magazines/fortune/2012/10/29/ulgy-apple.fortune/\\\">Apple&rsquo;s products were dull<\\/a>. Remember the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePad\\\">Newton<\\/a>? Thought not. Design didn&rsquo;t matter much. He almost quit several times. But when Steve Jobs, who had been ousted in 1985, returned to try to save the firm in 1996, he spotted Ive&rsquo;s talent and the two men set out on their maniacal journey to remake what they saw as the bland, lazy world around them. Or at least the bits of it they thought they could change. Unlike other electronics giants that make everything from computers to cameras to fridges, Apple makes and has only ever made three things: computers, entertainment devices and phones.<\\/p>\\n<p>Ive works in a design studio in a building on one corner of Apple&rsquo;s campus at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, the firm&rsquo;s address. It looks like all the other dull, un-Apple-like glass and beige &mdash; yes, beige &mdash; concrete blocks. With one really big difference. The glass is opaque and no-one other than Ive, his core team and top Apple executives is allowed in. &ldquo;The reason is, it&rsquo;s the one place you can go and see everything we&rsquo;re working on &mdash; all the designs, all the prototypes,&rdquo; Ive says.<\\/p>\\n<p>His team, from Britain, America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, &ldquo;is really much smaller than you&rsquo;d think &mdash; about 15. Most of us have worked together for 15 to 20 years.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s useful. &ldquo;We can be bitterly critical of our work. The personal issues of ego have long since faded.&rdquo; The large open-plan studio is, like most of Ive&rsquo;s personal Apple products, all-white. A large wooden bench, like the Genius Bars in Apple Stores, is devoted to new products. At one end are a lot of CNCS &mdash; high-tech machines that are used to make prototypes. &ldquo;Everyone I work with shares the same love of and respect for making,&rdquo; he says.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"image-wrapper special-medium alignright\\\">\\n<figure class=\\\"inline-special_medium\\\"><img alt=\\\"Apple's 1998 iMac.\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" src=\\\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/apple-imac-1998-mac.jpg?w=380\\\"><\\/img><br>\\n\\n<\\/figure>\\n<\\/div>\\n<p>Ive starts a project by imagining what a new kind of product should be and what it should do. Only once he&rsquo;s answered those questions does he work out what it should look like. He seeks advice in unlikely places. He worked with confectionery manufacturers to perfect the translucent jelly-bean shades of his first big hit, the original iMac. He travelled to Niigata in northern Japan to see how metalworkers there beat metal thin, to help him create the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G4\\\">titanium Powerbook<\\/a>, the first lightweight aluminum laptop in a world of hefty black plastic slabs.<\\/p>\\n<p>He spent &ldquo;months and months and months&rdquo; working out the exact shape of the stand of the desktop iMac computer because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very hard to design something that you almost do not see because it just seems so obvious, natural and inevitable&rdquo;. When he has finished a product, even one as fresh and iconic as the white headphones that came with the first iPod, he is haunted by the idea: could I have done it better? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an affliction designers are cursed with,&rdquo; Ive frowns.<\\/p>\\n<p>It was an affliction he shared with Jobs, although he seemed to apply it to everything, with &mdash; almost &mdash; funny consequences. Ive recalls traveling with Jobs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d get to the hotel where we were going, we&rsquo;d check in and I&rsquo;d go up to my room. I&rsquo;d leave my bags by the door. I wouldn&rsquo;t unpack. I&rsquo;d go and sit on the bed and wait for the inevitable call from Steve: &lsquo;Hey Jony, this hotel sucks. let&rsquo;s go.&rsquo; &rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>Jobs&rsquo; presence still looms large at Apple. Outside the room where Ive and I meet is one of his sayings printed in huge letters on the wall. It reads: &ldquo;If you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what&rsquo;s next.&rdquo; What made the two men work so well together? After all, they are very different. Ive has a gentle, easy-going manner. The laser-sharp intensity of his ideas is leavened by warmth and humor, much of it self-deprecating. No one ever described Jobs as easygoing or self-deprecating. &ldquo;When we were looking at objects, what our eyes physically saw and what we came to perceive were exactly the same. And we would ask the same questions, have the same curiosity about things.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"special-article-ad special-article-ad-small alignright\\\" data-pos=\\\"2\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" id=\\\"special-article-24909-2\\\"><\\/div>\\n<p>Was Jobs as tough as people say? Stories abound of him humiliating underlings and even &mdash; perhaps especially &mdash; top executives. &ldquo;So much has been written about Steve, and I don&rsquo;t recognize my friend in much of it. Yes, he had a surgically precise opinion. Yes, it could sting. Yes, he constantly questioned. &lsquo;Is this good enough? Is this right?&rsquo; but he was so clever. His ideas were bold and magnificent. They could suck the air from the room. And when the ideas didn&rsquo;t come, he decided to believe we would eventually make something great. And, oh, the joy of getting there!&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>For such a determined maker, you might think that Ive would single out a product, probably the iPhone, as his greatest achievement. It is certainly the most copied invention of the modern era. But it is an idea he likes most. He and his team have, he says, proved that consumers are not the price-obsessed philistines they are often assumed to be.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re surrounded by anonymous, poorly made objects. It&rsquo;s tempting to think it&rsquo;s because the people who use them don&rsquo;t care &mdash; just like the people who make them. But what we&rsquo;ve shown is that people do care. It&rsquo;s not just about aesthetics. They care about things that are thoughtfully conceived and well made. We make and sell a very, very large number of (hopefully) beautiful, well-made things. our success is a victory for purity, integrity &mdash; for giving a damn.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p><span class=\\\"pullquote\\\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about aesthetics. Our success is a victory for purity, integrity &mdash; for giving a damn&rdquo;<\\/span>Perhaps. But critics complain about the built-in obsolescence of Apple products, its hermetically sealed operating systems, the need to buy new chargers for new products and the prices it charges. Oh, the prices! $20 for a plastic charger that probably costs less than $2 to make! Chargers and iOS are matters for Apple&rsquo;s software fellas and the firm&rsquo;s new boss, Tim Cook. When it comes to obsolescence, Ive himself concedes he is carrying the fifth version of a phone that was only invented in 2007, with, yes, a new charger. But, he says: &ldquo;One of the things that is distinct about our products is that they get reused and passed on.&rdquo; What do you do with your old iPhones? &ldquo;Erm. Actually, they&rsquo;re not mine. They&rsquo;re the company&rsquo;s.&rdquo; What does the company do with them? &ldquo;We reuse stuff and then we&rsquo;ll disassemble stuff and recycle stuff. I understand what&rsquo;s behind the question, but I think it&rsquo;s a fundamental &mdash; and good &mdash; part of the human condition to try to make things better. That&rsquo;s the role we&rsquo;re playing.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>On price, Ive points out that developing life-changing products that we could not have imagined before but when we see them we want at once, is very expensive. What&rsquo;s more, manufacturing them the Apple way, often to tolerances far higher than needed, costs a bomb. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons. Quite the reverse,&rdquo; he laughs. Ive picks up his iPhone to demonstrate how technically complex its construction is. &ldquo;The body is made from a single piece of machined <em>aluminium<\\/em>,&rdquo; he says, sticking to the British pronunciation Jobs used to tease him about. &ldquo;The whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters. The cutters don&rsquo;t usually last very long, so we had to figure out a way of mass-manufacturing long-lasting ones. The camera cover is sapphire crystal. Look at the details around the sim-card slot. It&rsquo;s extraordinary!&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"image-wrapper special-medium alignleft\\\">\\n<figure class=\\\"inline-special_medium\\\"><img alt=\\\"'s iPhone 5s.\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" src=\\\"http://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/iphone5s-gold-ios7-apple-mac.jpg?w=380\\\"><\\/img><br>\\n\\n<\\/figure>\\n<\\/div>\\n<p>It&rsquo;s pretty, all right, and doubtless costs a pretty penny to make. But there&rsquo;s something else at play, something Ive won&rsquo;t say. As long as Apple keeps on making such wildly innovative products &mdash; no other manufacturer, not even Apple&rsquo;s arch-rival Samsung, has even come close to beating the iPad, and not for want of trying &mdash; Apple can charge whatever it likes and consumers will pony up. Apple sells about 250m iPhones, iPads and Macs a year and, since its launch, customers have downloaded more than 25 billion songs and 1 billion TV episodes from the iTunes Store &mdash; all with margins that make its competitors weep.<\\/p>\\n<p>Ive talks so much more about making things than designing them, it seems odd that he has chosen to work in tech, where so much of the magic is in the software, not the hardware. You can&rsquo;t touch tech. There are no wheels or moving parts in an iPad or an iPhone. Ive says tech products offer something unique &mdash; and uniquely challenging. &ldquo;The product you have in your hand, or put into your ear, or have in your pocket, is more personal than the product you have on your desk. The struggle to make something as difficult and demanding as technology so intimately personal is what first attracted me to Apple. People have an incredibly personal relationship with what we make.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<\\/section>\\n\\t\\t\\t<section class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n<p>That relationship is getting closer all the time. The new big thing is wearable tech. Google has brought out web-enabled Google Glass spectacles. Samsung and Sony have introduced web-linked smartwatches. Will Apple make an iWatch? &ldquo;Obviously, there are rumors about us working on&hellip; and, obviously, I&rsquo;m not going to talk about that. It&rsquo;s a game of chess, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Sounds like the <a href=\\\"http://www.jaeger-lecoultre.com/US/en/luxury-watches/home-page\\\">Jaeger-LeCoultre<\\/a> sports watch he&rsquo;s wearing is not long for his wrist &mdash; even though he designed it himself for an AIDS-charity auction and it is only one of three in the world.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"special-article-ad special-article-ad-small alignright\\\" data-pos=\\\"3\\\" data-size=\\\"small\\\" id=\\\"special-article-24909-3\\\"><\\/div>\\n<p>That&rsquo;s the trouble with tech. It changes so quickly. Just when you think you have the best gadget, something newer, cooler, comes along &mdash; usually something made by Ive. Not that Apple&rsquo;s hundreds of millions of fans care. The newer it is, the more they like it. But should they? When Ive sees customers queueing overnight to buy the latest iPhone, does he worry that we have become too obsessed with the latest &ldquo;this&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rdquo;, that we are genuflecting at the altar of technology? A phone is just a phone, not the second coming of Christ. &ldquo;What people are responding to is much bigger than the object. They are responding to something rare &mdash; a group of people who do more than simply make something work, they make the very best products they possibly can. It&rsquo;s a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness,&rdquo; he says.<\\/p>\\n<p>It&rsquo;s the first time in more than an hour and a half that Ive allows himself to be a little grand. Beneath his studiously modest public demeanor lies a heart of solid steel &mdash; ok, aluminum. He&rsquo;d have to have terabytes of confidence and resolve to win the battles that Jobs deliberately fostered between senior executives in a brutally Darwinian effort to get the best from each of them.<\\/p>\\n<p>I hear it again when I ask whether he is flattered or frustrated when he sees his designs so widely referenced, reworked &mdash; ok, copied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s theft,&rdquo; he replies in a heartbeat, his eyes narrowing sharply. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s copied isn&rsquo;t just a design, it&rsquo;s thousands and thousands of hours of struggle. It&rsquo;s only when you&rsquo;ve achieved what you set out to do that you can say, &lsquo;This was worth pursuing.&rsquo; It takes years of investment, years of pain.&rdquo; Jobs put Ive&rsquo;s anger into action. He severed ties with the Google boss and former Apple board member Eric Schmidt, when it emerged the search giant was developing its own answer to the iPhone. Jobs also successfully sued Samsung for $1 billion for ripping off Apple&rsquo;s ideas.<\\/p>\\n<p><span class=\\\"pullquote\\\">&ldquo;Yes, Steve Jobs had a surgically precise opinion. Yes, it could sting. But his ideas were so bold and magnificent. They could suck the air from the room&rdquo;<\\/span>Ive describes Jobs as &ldquo;my closest friend&rdquo; and says he finds it &ldquo;odd and tough to talk about him, because it doesn&rsquo;t feel that long ago that he died.&rdquo; There is, perhaps, another reason. Since Jobs died, Apple has hit a rough patch, at least by its ludicrously high standards. It has not had a break-out hit. There has been no Apple TV set to revolutionize home entertainment. No spiffy watch. (Yet.) The firm&rsquo;s share price has slumped and it has lost its title of the world&rsquo;s most valuable firm. Some speculate that, without Jobs, Apple has lost its golden touch. An acclaimed new book by the former <em>Wall Street Journal<\\/em> technology writer Yukari Iwatani Kane dubs the company &ldquo;the haunted empire.&rdquo; Others say it has killed its own future: that by creating so many extraordinary products in such a short time, it has run out of things to invent.<\\/p>\\n<p>If that were true, if Apple could no longer make stuff that shreds, not pushes, the envelope, would Ive give up? &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;d stop. I&rsquo;d make things for myself, for my friends at home instead. The bar needs to be high.&rdquo; But, he adds: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that will happen. We are at the beginning of a remarkable time, when a remarkable number of products will be developed. When you think about technology and what it has enabled us to do so far, and what it will enable us to do in future, we&rsquo;re not even close to any kind of limit. It&rsquo;s still so, so new.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, after all the years of toil, all the gazillions he&rsquo;s made, he&rsquo;s still remarkably hungry. &ldquo;At Apple, there&rsquo;s almost a joy in looking at your ignorance and realizing, &lsquo;Wow, we&rsquo;re going to learn about this and, by the time we&rsquo;re done, we&rsquo;re going to really understand and do something great.&rsquo; Apple is imperfect, like every large collection of people. But we have a rare quality. There is this almost pre-verbal, instinctive understanding about what we do, why we do it. We share the same values.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>So the best of Jony Ive, the best of Apple, is still to come? &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; And, with that, he gulps down the last of his now-cold Earl Grey and heads back through the warm California rain to his secret lab. Tomorrow doesn&rsquo;t wait for the man who designs it.<\\/p>\\n<p><em>John Arlidge writes for the Sunday Times Magazine.

 "{\"author\":\"Paul Taykalo\",\"text\":\"This tool was developed long time ago, and the first post about it, wasn\\u2019t created by its author:) It\\u2019s a Dynamic Code Injection Tool or DYCI.\\nPrologue\\nThere was a programmer too lazy to re-launch an application each time, so he has added some changes into its code.\\nI hope you know what Code Injection is. In general, these words are used when we\\u2019re talking about security holes, exploitation of some bugs in the code or about some other nasty things happened. But not today. Today we\\u2019ll discuss how to use code injection to accelerate the software development cycle. In short:\\nFor one, this tool allows you to update code/resources of your iOS application without its restart.\\nSecond, if you may wish to try it right way, just go to the DYCI github page and follow the instructions.\\nStory\\nThe reason for this tool has been crafted in the first place is the laziness of the programmer, who was working on a rather big project. The programmer liked to write the code but it was annoying for him to wait while this big project was in the process of being compiled. But it wasn\\u2019t only about project compilation itself. In order to see changes the programmer introduced into the project, he had to go through a whole bunch of UIViewControllers, to press various buttons, to wait for server responses and attend network operations. And for each change he made he needed to go through this path again. And again, and again\\u2026\\nMake changes. Wait until the project is compiled. Run the application. Go to the screen where you can see the desired result. Repeat the cycle until the desired result is achieved.\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s no problem with this flow\\u201d, \\u2013 you may say. But, actually, there is one. And it\\u2019s a big one, as a matter of fact. In large projects, the amount of time you need to go from making changes to checking results can be really substantial.\\nThe largest interval the programmer had ever experienced was about two and a half minutes. For one change only! But the funniest thing is that another programmer worked on the same project was in this \\u201cchange->compile->find->check\\u201d cycle for about two hours while trying to introduce a small change that would allow seeing the desired result. Each time when the programmer added a small fix he thought with no doubts that small change would be final. And each time he had failed. He had started to debug the program to understand what was going on. Then he realized that when he had tried to debug the program, its behavior had changed, and bug wasn\\u2019t appearing. So he had started to add logs and, finally, at the end of the second hour, he found the bug and successfully fixed it.\\nThe problem is that most of the programmers may end up in in this cycle for hours. It\\u2019s like a gambling. Each time you\\u2019re pretty sure that this time you will definitely win. But you\\u2019re continuing to fail again and again, wasting your and/or clients\\u2019 time and money. And then you get frustrated, start hating the project, work, testers because they found this bug; project manager for he\\u2019s saying that you\\u2019ve spent too much time on this small fix:), and so on.\\nDon\\u2019t allow this happen on your projects. Really. Time is a very precious substance. Your mood is of significant importance as well.\\nWhy do I need to wait so long? I\\u2019ve changed only one line of code!\\nSolution\\nThere are many things you can do in this very situation, and they are as follows:\\nWrite test (in general it\\u2019s much faster then trying to recheck everything manually).\\nUpdate your application starting point to be able to jump right to the screen you need.\\nAdd logs for complex logic parts. Use a framework enabling to go on/off logs.\\n\\u2026<Insert your solution>.\\nUse DYCI :)\\nDYCI\\nAs already mentioned, DYCI is a tool that allows you to see changes that you\\u2019ve made almost immediately, right from or AppCode IDE.\\nHere\\u2019s a link to the video that shows how the DYCI tool can be used.\\nAll you need to make this work in your project is to install it in your system, add DYCI to your project via Framework or CocoaPods, and that\\u2019s it. After these steps you\\u2019ll be able to insert code into your running project.\\nHow it works\\nIn short, when you\\u2019re pressing the hot-key, DYCI plugin recompiles the current file in the same way as it was compiled before, wraps the object file into dynamic library (Yes, I know you\\u2019re not allowed to do it in iOS), then the DYCI library in your app loads contents of the dynamic library into your app and performs a code update. There\\u2019s a more detailed description on the DYCI wiki.\\nAfter the code injection, DYCI library calls -(void)updateOnClassInjection method on each instance of injected class(es). This instances notification is the crucial part since the code you\\u2019ve changed needs to be run somehow. For example, if you\\u2019ve changed the method that is called each time when you\\u2019re pressing a button, then you can just press the button again. If you\\u2019ve changed the view WillAppear method, you can move back, and return to this controller afterwards. But in some complex cases you can add any code that will trigger the changes into -(void)updateOnClassInjection method. For example, if you\\u2019re playing with view layout, you can add this code:\\n- (void)updateOnClassInjection { [self setNeedsLayout]; [self layoutIfNeeded]; }\\nThat\\u2019s all. You don\\u2019t need to be in the \\u201cchange->run->find->check\\u201d cycle. Now you can update it to the \\u201cchange->inject->check\\u201d cycle. Profit. :)\\nSilver bullet?\\nSad to say, but DYCI is not a silver bullet that can potentially solve all your problems. And there are some reasons for that:\\nObjective-C is a compiled language and it has some restrictions (static variables are hard to inject).\\nProgrammers write hard-to-inject codes :) It is true. We are:) (Single tones are not supposed to be changed).\\nLife-cycle of objects sometimes doesn\\u2019t allow you to inject properly code (sometimes it\\u2019s hard to rewrite the object initialization phase).\\nBut still, even with the limitations specified above, DYCI can accelerate the development process.\\nPossible usages\\nAdd/change method of class.\\nAdd logs to the class.\\nUpdate layout/screens.\\nRun small test code (Whatever comes into your mind).\\nDebug current object state (Sometimes debugger sucks).\\nUpdate strings in Localized.strings file.\\nEpilogue\\nThink about this tool as of yet-another-tool in a developer\\u2019s Swiss knife. As for me, I always add it to my project and use it when it\\u2019s really needed. :)\\nCheers.\",\"title\":\"Dynamic Code Injection for Good\",\"images\":[{\"primary\":\"true\",\"url\":\"http://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/change-compile-find-check.png\"},{\"url\":\"http://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/change-inject-check.png\"}],\"html\":\"<div class=\\\"post-5056 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-blog tag-development tag-productivity\\\" id=\\\"post-5056\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\\"entry-content\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>This tool was developed long time ago, and the first post about it, wasn&rsquo;t created by its author:) It&rsquo;s&nbsp;a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/DyCI/dyci-main\\\">Dynamic Code Injection Tool<\\/a>&nbsp;or DYCI.<\\/p>\\n<h2><strong>Prologue<\\/strong><\\/h2>\\n<blockquote><p>There was a programmer too lazy to re-launch an application each time, so he has added some changes into its code.<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<div>I hope you know what&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Code Injection\\\">Code Injection<\\/a>&nbsp;is.

While LINQ is the best thing that ever happened to .NET, and using it is so much fun and makes life so much easier, writing your own LINQ provider is \\u201ccomplicated\\u201d to say the least (context- the LINQ interface to NHibernate, RavenDB or Lucene \\u2013 those are all providers).\\nA quick outline of the series:\\nA primer (this post)\\nA Primer\\nIf you\\u2019ve used LINQ, you know there are two distinct syntaxes:\\nThe \\u201cquery\\u201d style:\\nfrom item in items where item.Id == 2 select item.Name\\nAnd the \\u201cmethod chaining\\u201d style:\\nitems.Where(item => item.Id == 2).Select(item ==> item.Name);\\nExcept for the style, they\\u2019re pretty much the same in that the former is really syntactic sugar that compiles down to the latter. Now, the latter, as we know, is a series of extension methods that become available when you import the namespace System.Linq. Within this, though, there are two flavors of LINQ that are very different in terms of their internals:\\nIEnumerable<T> and everything that supports it\\nIQueryable<T> and everything that supports it\\nThis means that when you call the same LINQ methods on an IEnumerable<T> versus an IQueryable<T>, very different things happen.\\nIEnumerable<T> and everything that supports it\\nThese are simpler to use in that all the work has already been done as part of the .NET Framework. You simply use it. If you want to extend this to a data source of your own, you simply build an enumerator for it (e.g. if you wanted to slap LINQ on top of flat files, you could build a FileEnumerable that uses a FileEnumerator that, in turn, deals with a FileStream).\\nThe extension methods are defined in System.Linq.Enumerable and the way they work is: each method, when called, wraps the IEnumerable it\\u2019s called on within a new implementation of IEnumerable that has knowledge of what operation is to be performed. These implementations are all private within theEnumerable class (e.g. Where on an array yields a WhereArrayIterator).

While LINQ is the best thing that ever happened to .NET, and using it is so much fun and makes life so much easier, writing your own LINQ provider is &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; to say the least (context- the LINQ interface to NHibernate, RavenDB or Lucene &ndash; those are all providers).<\\/p>\\n<p>A quick outline of the series:<\\/p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>A primer<\\/strong>&nbsp;(<em>this post<\\/em>)<\\/li>\\n\\n\\n\\n<\\/ol>\\n<hr><\\/hr>\\n<h3><strong>A Primer<\\/strong><\\/h3>\\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve used LINQ, you know there are two distinct syntaxes:<\\/p>\\n<p>The &ldquo;query&rdquo; style:<\\/p>\\n<pre><code>from item in items\\nwhere item.Id == 2\\nselect item.Name\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n<p>And the &ldquo;method chaining&rdquo; style:<\\/p>\\n<pre><code>items.Where(item =&gt; item.Id == 2).Select(item ==&gt; item.Name);\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n<p>Except for the style, they&rsquo;re pretty much the same in that the former is really syntactic sugar that compiles down to the latter. Now, the latter, as we know, is a series of extension methods that become available when you import the namespace&nbsp;<code>System.Linq<\\/code>. Within this, though, there are two flavors of LINQ that are very different in terms of their internals:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;<\\/code>&nbsp;and everything that supports it<\\/li>\\n<li><code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;<\\/code>&nbsp;and everything that supports it<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<p>This means that when you call the same LINQ methods on an&nbsp;<code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;<\\/code>&nbsp;versus an&nbsp;<code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;<\\/code>, very different things happen.<\\/p>\\n<h4><code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;<\\/code>&nbsp;and everything that supports it<\\/h4>\\n<p>These are simpler to use in that all the work has already been done as part of the .NET Framework. You simply use it. If you want to extend this to a data source of your own, you simply build an enumerator for it (e.g. if you wanted to slap LINQ on top of flat files, you could build a&nbsp;<code>FileEnumerable<\\/code>&nbsp;that uses a&nbsp;<code>FileEnumerator<\\/code>&nbsp;that, in turn, deals with a&nbsp;<code>FileStream<\\/code>).<\\/p>\\n<p>The extension methods are defined in&nbsp;<code>System.Linq.Enumerable<\\/code>&nbsp;and the way they work is: each method, when called, wraps the&nbsp;<code>IEnumerable<\\/code>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s called on within a new implementation of&nbsp;<code>IEnumerable<\\/code>&nbsp;that has knowledge of what operation is to be performed. These implementations are all private within the<code>Enumerable<\\/code>&nbsp;class (e.g.&nbsp;<code>Where<\\/code>&nbsp;on an array yields a&nbsp;<code>WhereArrayIterator<\\/code>). When the final enumeration happens, the pipeline executes and gives you the desired result. The scalar-returning methods such as&nbsp;<code>Any<\\/code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>First<\\/code>&nbsp;in this case are simple calls to the enumerator or&nbsp;<code>foreach<\\/code>&nbsp;on top of the underlying enumerable.<\\/p>\\n<p>All methods in this category deal with&nbsp;<code>Func<\\/code>&lsquo;s when it comes to predicates or mapping functions that are passed in.<\\/p>\\n<h4><code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;<\\/code>&nbsp;and everything that supports it<\\/h4>\\n<p>This is the focus of this series.

 "{\"text\":\"I have been interested in standing desks for a while. A standing desk is a desk conceived for writing, reading, or working, while standing up or while sitting on a high stool. The impact of such desks on our health has been quantified, and several reports have come out pointing out the dangersof sittingtoolong (e.g. risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, a variety of cancers, and an early death). According to most people using standing desks, they even make you more productive, but I didn't find any formal report confirming that yet.\\nAfter having given standing desk a try with cardboard last week, I decided to build my own standing desk, on top of my existing desk, for less than 30 euros ($40). There are plenty examples of DIY standing desks on the Internet, but that one is probably the best known, and this is the one I used as an example.\\nFirst, I needed the following items:\\ntwo side tables (2 x 7 euros);\\ntwo black brackets (2 x 1.5 euros);\\na black rubber slab with adhesive backing (8 euros);\\nwood glue, screws, and a few tools (free).\\nThen, it was time to write down THE plan. I needed to put the keyboard at the height of 32cm starting from the top of my existing desk, and the main monitor at the height of 10-15cm upper.\\nThe side tables are square (50x50cm), and their height (42cm) perfectly fits my needs, given my existing desk dimensions as described above. That is why I chose such side tables actually, and this made things a lot easier.\\nOne side table has been used as is, and will support the main screen. The other side table has been split (25cm depth, and 32cm height), and will be used for either a laptop or a keyboard. In order to screw the brackets on the half table, I crafted two wood blocks that I put into the table, that one being made of wood with paper filling. This happens when you buy cheap furniture... Adding these blocks did the trick though.\\nI did the same thing for the two hollow legs of the half table, gluing blocks of wood into them so that it looks exactly like the original legs. Here, I reused the blocks that were located in the offcuts of the two legs I cut.\\nAt that time, everything was ready for assembling. I put up the other side table, then I screwed the short legs and the brackets on the half table.\\nSort of protip, I used a black marker to color the edges of the half table in order to make them pretty. Version 1 will not hide the back of the half table unfortunately. I didn't find a satisfying solution yet.\\nThen, I screwed the half table part to the main side table, and cut and stuck rubber pads on each leg. That way, the whole piece of furniture should be pretty stable once put on the desk.\\nAnd voil\u00e0! I am ready to work standing up. It is worth mentioning that I can double the space of the upper surface, if I want to, by simply buying another side table (I actually bought a few ones already, just in case you know). I also kept the other part of the table I cut so that I can possibly build another similar piece of furniture.\\nI would like to thank Jean-Pierre who has provided me all tools I needed.\\nUPDATE: I started to use an Apple Wireless Keyboard and a Magic Mouse rather than directly using my laptop.\\nBy the way, if you found a typo, please fork and edit this post.

The authors say one explanation could be that more intelligent individuals are better at judging character and so they tend to form relationships with people who are less likely to betray them. Another reason could be that smarter individuals are better at weighing up situations, recognising when there is a strong incentive for the other person not to meet their side of the deal.\\nThe study, published in the journal, PLOS ONE, supports previous research that analysed data on trust and intelligence from European countries. The authors say the research is significant because social trust contributes to the success of important social institutions, such as welfare systems and financial markets. In addition, research shows that individuals who trust others report better health and greater happiness.\\nThe Oxford researchers found, however, that the links between trust and health, and between trust and happiness, are not explained by intelligence. For example, individuals who trust others might have only reported better health and greater happiness because they were more intelligent. But this turns out not to be the case. The finding confirms that trust is a valuable resource for an individual, and is not simply a proxy for intelligence.\\nLead author Noah Carl, from the Department of Sociology, said: \\u2018Intelligence is shown to be linked with trusting others, even after taking into account factors like marital status, education and income.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico\",\"author\":\"Dave Evans\",\"text\":\"For the next two weeks, we\\u2019re running a trial in conjunction with Radio 3 to deliver surround sound to your browser for a series of classical music concerts. On the Radio 3 blog, Rupert Brun explains the background to the trial and how to get involved. David Evans explains the technology we\\u2019re using.\\nHere in Broadcast & Connected Systems at BBC R&D, we are always looking for new ways to apply our technology research to extend the reach of BBC content to the maximum number of users. Surround sound isn\\u2019t new, but delivering it to the home via the Internet has traditionally meant installing plugins or other applications, limiting the platforms and consumers we can target.\\nIn this experiment, we believe we are the first broadcaster in the world to stream a live outside broadcast in discrete multichannel audio to the home using MPEG-DASH, and we're doing it using just a compliant web browser - no plugins, no separate software installation required.\\nWhy stream to the browser, and why now?\\nThe beauty of the browser is that it is (almost) ubiquitous. Every PC, tablet and smart phone has a browser installed when it ships. Increasingly, smart TVs, set top boxes and games consoles have some form of browser environment available, bringing HTML5, CSS and Javascript functionality to the majority of consumer electronic devices.\\nPeople expect to be able to consume BBC content on any platform. To enable this, the BBC currently has to support a number of streaming protocols and has to maintain many different applications with differing code bases and levels of functionality in order to support hundreds of different set top boxes, smart TVs, mobile devices and desktop environments.\\nWhat if we could have a single encoding and distribution workflow and a single cross-platform client application, reducing the complexity of distribution and allowing our developers to concentrate on delivering great user experiences?\\nFrom a listener\\u2019s perspective, the browser \\u201cjust works\\u201d which makes accessing our services much easier. Removing the requirement to install plugins or other software removes a significant barrier for some users. Indeed, for cross-platform compatibility, security and stability, many browser vendors have decided not to support plugins in the future so we need to move away from these anyway.\\nThree particular technical standards should enable us to do this in the future: HTML5, MPEG-DASH (a subject previously featured on this blog), and W3C Media Source Extensions.\\nHTML5 and Media Source Extensions (MSE)\\nIn HTML5 the HTMLMediaElement, typically a <video> or <audio> tag, exposes a source element which accepts a URL of the content to be played. The browser retrieves, decodes and plays the media data automatically, providing it knows how to handle your media type. This offers simplicity for the developer and, in theory, has removed the need for plugins, but the trade-off is that there is no control over many important variables: how data is downloaded and from where, how much data is buffered, which adaptive streaming algorithms to use or what to do in case of failure. The ability to control these variables is key to providing a world-class user experience, but by default they are hard-coded into the browser. Ideally we want to hand as much control as possible to the Javascript application, while still deferring to the browser for parsing, decoding and rendering the media data. Typically, Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight applications have been used to provide all of this functionality on those platforms that support those plugins.\\nMost of these features can be replicated in Javascript but, until now, it has not been possible to feed media data to the HTMLMediaElement. The Media Source Extensions define a Javascript API which allows media streams to be constructed dynamically within a Javascript application.\\nAt the heart of MSE is the MediaSource object. This object is created by the application and attached to the media element. Its purpose is to provide the media data for playback as requested by the media element.\\nThe MediaSource object maintains a collection of SourceBuffers. These are the interface through which the application appends media data to the source and methods are provided to insert, remove and manage media data. They are essentially an abstraction of a timeline \\u2013 media data can appended to the buffer based on media playback timestamp, or it can be appended sequentially, ignoring timestamps. The latter mode enables unrelated media to be spliced together, which allows uses such as advert insertion or even video editing in the browser.\\nThe application handles the requesting of media data from the server and appends the response to the SourceBuffer. Decoupling the fetching of media data from playback allows the media data to be sourced using novel transport mechanisms or from different locations.\\nSourceBuffers can contain audio, video or timed text and an instance is created for each stream that needs to be presented. Typically there might be one video stream, one audio stream and perhaps a subtitle stream. Since each media type is handled separately, access services such as audio description or subtitling can be selected simply by requesting a different stream.\\nFinally, the specification also includes extensions to the HTMLVideoElement allowing measurement of video decode and rendering performance which could be used to help decide the most appropriate video stream to present if a number of options are available.\\nAn additional benefit of not hardcoding features into the browser is that any functionality upgrades such as improved adaptive algorithms or defect fixes are simply a case of updating the Javascript application, which is freshly fetched each time the page is loaded, rather than requiring every user to upgrade their browser. Software updates to the browser itself might be fairly easy on a PC but happen infrequently on a smart TV or set top box.\\nContent delivery using MPEG-DASH\\nMPEG-DASH is the new standard for delivering media content over the Internet. It is designed to allow content to be delivered efficiently in a segmented form, making use of standard caching techniques for web content in order to deliver to large audiences. It supports bitrate adaptation, allowing each viewer to receive a stream in the best quality that their Internet connection can deliver.\\nSince even surround audio streams need only a low bitrate connection, we are not using bitrate adaptation for this trial. The audio stream is simply encoded at a constant rate of 320 kbps using AAC-LC. However, MPEG-DASH still takes care of dividing the live audio stream into short segments that the client can retrieve using HTTP. Most importantly, MPEG-DASH is a streaming standard which can be implemented for a browser using the W3C Media Source Extensions.\\nBuilding a MPEG-DASH player using MSE\\nIn order to deliver the surround audio to you, a DASH player application needs to at least perform the following tasks:\\nCreate a MediaSource object and set it as the source of the media element\\nRequest and parse manifest and create SourceBuffer objects for each enabled stream\\nRequest segments for each stream and append them to the SourceBuffers\\nRepeat step 3\\nQuite a lot of code is required just for those few steps. For this trial, we\\u2019ve chosen to use a modified version of dash.js, an open-source MPEG-DASH player implemented entirely in Javascript.\\nWhere next?\\nMSE has recently reached Candidate Recommendation stage, meaning that it should be complete enough to allow implementation, but browser support is still limited.\\nRight now, Chrome (33 or higher), and IE11 on Windows 8.1, are the only browsers we\\u2019ve seen which support enough features for our trial. If you\\u2019re a fan of Firefox, Safari or other browsers, these currently have incomplete support, though many of these vendors have publicly stated they are working on it.\\nAs support for these features becomes more widespread, we expect that more and more content on the Internet will be delivered this way. Other content providers are also starting to use these techniques: Netflix has deployed a MSE-based player \\u2013 this is the default player if you are using IE11 on Windows 8.1. Youtube has also deployed a MSE-based player for some content on some platforms.\\nAlthough we are actively experimenting with MSE in BBC R&D, there are no immediate plans to launch any BBC services using the technology. Nevertheless, HTML5, MPEG-DASH and MSE are a powerful set of standards that are sure to play a significant role in delivering media content on the Internet in the coming years.\",\"title\":\"Look, no plugins: Live streaming to the browser using Media Source Extensions and MPEG-DASH\",\"html\":\"<div><div class=\\\"leadin panel markdown\\\">\\n        \\n          <p>For the next two weeks, we&rsquo;re running a <a href=\\\"http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/radio3/index.html\\\">trial<\\/a> in conjunction with Radio 3 to deliver surround sound to your browser for a series of classical music concerts.  On the <a href=\\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio3/posts/Radio-3-in-40\\\">Radio 3 blog<\\/a>, Rupert Brun explains the background to the trial and how to get involved. David Evans explains the technology we&rsquo;re using.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Here in Broadcast &amp; Connected Systems at BBC R&amp;D, we are always looking for new ways to apply our technology research to extend the reach of BBC content to the maximum number of users. Surround sound isn&rsquo;t new, but delivering it to the home via the Internet has traditionally meant installing plugins or other applications, limiting the platforms and consumers we can target.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>In this experiment, we believe we are the first broadcaster in the world to stream a live outside broadcast in discrete multichannel audio to the home using MPEG-DASH, and we're doing it using just a compliant web browser - no plugins, no separate software installation required.<\\/p>\\n\\n        \\n      <\\/div><div class=\\\"text panel\\\">\\n        \\n        \\n          <h4>Why stream to the browser, and why now?<\\/h4>\\n<p>The beauty of the browser is that it is (almost) ubiquitous. Every PC, tablet and smart phone has a browser installed when it ships. Increasingly, smart TVs, set top boxes and games consoles have some form of browser environment available, bringing HTML5, CSS and Javascript functionality to the majority of consumer electronic devices.<\\/p>\\n<p>People expect to be able to consume BBC content on any platform. To enable this, the BBC currently has to support a number of streaming protocols and has to maintain many different applications with differing code bases and levels of functionality in order to support hundreds of different set top boxes, smart TVs, mobile devices and desktop environments.<\\/p>\\n<p>What if we could have a single encoding and distribution workflow and a single cross-platform client application, reducing the complexity of distribution and allowing our developers to concentrate on delivering great user experiences?<\\/p>\\n<p>From a listener&rsquo;s perspective, the browser &ldquo;just works&rdquo; which makes accessing our services much easier. Removing the requirement to install plugins or other software removes a significant barrier for some users. Indeed, for cross-platform compatibility, security and stability, many browser vendors have decided not to support plugins in the future so we need to move away from these anyway.<\\/p>\\n<p>Three particular technical standards should enable us to do this in the future: <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5\\\">HTML5<\\/a>, MPEG-DASH (a subject&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2013/09/mpeg-dash-test-streams\\\">previously featured<\\/a>&nbsp;on this blog), and W3C&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/\\\">Media Source Extensions<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n<h4>HTML5 and Media Source Extensions (MSE)<\\/h4>\\n<p>In HTML5 the HTMLMediaElement, typically a &lt;video&gt; or &lt;audio&gt; tag, exposes a source element which accepts a URL of the content to be played. The browser retrieves, decodes and plays the media data automatically, providing it knows how to handle your media type. This offers simplicity for the developer and, in theory, has removed the need for plugins, but the trade-off is that there is no control over many important variables: how data is downloaded and from where, how much data is buffered, which adaptive streaming algorithms to use or what to do in case of failure. The ability to control these variables is key to providing a world-class user experience, but by default they are hard-coded into the browser. Ideally we want to hand as much control as possible to the Javascript application, while still deferring to the browser for parsing, decoding and rendering the media data. Typically, Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight applications have been used to provide all of this functionality on those platforms that support those plugins.<\\/p>\\n<p>Most of these features can be replicated in Javascript but, until now, it has not been possible to feed media data to the HTMLMediaElement. The Media Source Extensions define a Javascript API which allows media streams to be constructed dynamically within a Javascript application.<\\/p>\\n<p>At the heart of MSE is the MediaSource object. This object is created by the application and attached to the media element. Its purpose is to provide the media data for playback as requested by the media element.<\\/p>\\n<p>The MediaSource object maintains a collection of SourceBuffers. These are the interface through which the application appends media data to the source and methods are provided to insert, remove and manage media data. They are essentially an abstraction of a timeline &ndash; media data can appended to the buffer based on media playback timestamp, or it can be appended sequentially, ignoring timestamps. The latter mode enables unrelated media to be spliced together, which allows uses such as advert insertion or even video editing in the browser.<\\/p>\\n<p>The application handles the requesting of media data from the server and appends the response to the SourceBuffer. Decoupling the fetching of media data from playback allows the media data to be sourced using novel transport mechanisms or from different locations.<\\/p>\\n<p>SourceBuffers can contain audio, video or timed text and an instance is created for each stream that needs to be presented. Typically there might be one video stream, one audio stream and perhaps a subtitle stream. Since each media type is handled separately, access services such as audio description or subtitling can be selected simply by requesting a different stream.<\\/p>\\n<p>Finally, the specification also includes extensions to the HTMLVideoElement allowing measurement of video decode and rendering performance which could be used to help decide the most appropriate video stream to present if a number of options are available.<\\/p>\\n<p>An additional benefit of not hardcoding features into the browser is that any functionality upgrades such as improved adaptive algorithms or defect fixes are simply a case of updating the Javascript application, which is freshly fetched each time the page is loaded, rather than requiring every user to upgrade their browser.

 "{\"author\":\"Jon Ostrower\",\"text\":\"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia\\u2014The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 expanded by thousands of miles in an operation of unprecedented scale, marked by a series of twists that have made the least likely scenarios the most credible.\\nThe number of countries searching for the flight, which fell off radar March 8 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, doubled to roughly two dozen over the weekend. Searchers are now looking for debris more than 3,200 miles away from the point at which they believe the plane's transponders and another signaling system were deliberately turned off about an hour into the flight.\\nMalaysian authorities now say they believe foul play was behind the plane's vanishing, and police are investigating all crew and passengers on the flight as well as engineers who may have had contact with the aircraft before takeoff. Police searched the pilots' homes over the weekend, but Malaysia's transport ministry said there was no evidence so far linking the pilots to the plane's disappearance.\\nHowever, on Sunday, Malaysia's transport minister said key communication equipment that keeps the ground updated about the health of a flying aircraft and its engines was disabled on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 before the last recorded conversation with the cockpit.\\n\\\"Yes, it was before,\\\" Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference Sunday in response to a reporter's question about whether the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, of Flight 370 was disabled before someone said, \\\"All right, good night\\\" from the cockpit.\\nThe ACARS system being disabled before the last voice message from the cockpit backs up thinking by experts that somebody with intricate understanding of the Boeing 777-200 jet and its systems tampered with communication equipment on board. The system apparently could only have been disabled by someone in the cockpit, according to an executive of Rockwell Collins, which bought ARINC, the firm that invented the ACARS system. The executive spoke to The Wall Street Journal on condition of anonymity.\\nOn Thursday, Mr. Hishammuddin said the last automated message was sent out by the ACARS system at 1:07 a.m. Malaysia time. But he didn't say then whether the system was disabled before or after the last comment from the cockpit.\\nThe identity of the person making the last statement\\u2014 \\\" All right, good night\\\"\\u2014hasn't been confirmed. Pilots are expected to read back important information, such as frequency change instructions, given to them by air-traffic controllers to ensure they've received the correct message, though these rules aren't always strictly followed.\\nThe transponder signal from Flight 370 was lost at 1:21 a.m. All radar contact with the aircraft was lost a few minutes afterwards, according to Malaysian investigators. Transponders are another set of communication devices on aircraft that help identify individual flights to controllers on the ground.\\nSatellite tracking suggests the plane likely traveled for hours and ended up along one of two possible corridors: one that stretches from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and the other from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.\\n\\\"At this stage, both the northern and southern corridors are being treated with equal importance,\\\" Malaysian Defense Minister and Acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said.\\nAir-safety experts said there has never been a search for remnants of an aircraft spanning such a vast area.\\n\\\"The enormous size of the air and sea fleet searching, and the number of countries involved\\u2014I haven't seen anything like it,\\\" said Harro Ranter, president of the Aviation Safety Network, a service that tracks air accidents.\\nDepending on how long the effort lasts and how extensive a region leaders of the search eventually want to cover, some early estimates are that it could end up encompassing nearly 300,000 square miles.\\nAir-safety investigators rely heavily on precedent to solve mysteries that surround air accidents. But in Flight 370's case normal procedures and investigative practices aren't applicable, several air-safety experts said, because the probe is focused on apparent deliberate acts by someone or a group whose motives remain unknown. And at this point, investigators have no clear-cut clues from any wreckage or debris.\\n\\\"I've never heard of anything as wild as some of the data\\\" coming out of this investigation, said Jim Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.\\nAccording to Mr. Hall, \\\"the only consistent thing is that every expert has changed his mind at least once\\\" during the course of the investigation.\\nIn a development that could help narrow the search, five Asian nations over the weekend said their radar systems hadn't detected any sign of the Malaysia Airlines aircraft that has been missing for nine days. Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, India and Pakistan\\u2014which all might have been on the flight path of the wayward Boeing 777\\u2014said there was no sign the plane had flown over their territories.\\n\\\"Such a large object could not have gone undetected,\\\" said one Indian military official in Port Blair in the Andaman Islands.\\nStill, investigators weren't willing to rule out the possibility that the plane and its 239 passengers and crew traveled over or near those countries.\\nThe twin possible paths of the errant jetliner were derived from calculations using the jet's last known position, speed and likely fuel consumption allowing investigators to determine where Flight 370 was last seen and where it might have later exhausted its fuel.\\nThe only aviation search that even approached the scope of the current effort, according to government safety officials and independent experts, was the hunt for debris after the 2003 breakup of the space shuttle Columbia as it re-entered the atmosphere over Texas. Debris collected from the Columbia disaster, which killed seven astronauts, amounted to 84,000 separate pieces. Remnants of one liquid oxygen tank weren't found until eight years later.\\nMalaysian officials called together representatives of 22 countries Sunday and asked for assistance in tracking the plane's movements, including the countries along the two corridors where the search is now under way.\\n\\\"The nature of the search has changed,\\\" Mr. Hishammuddin said. \\\"From focusing mainly on shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans.\\\"\\nThe U.S. Navy over the weekend added more-advanced aerial surveillance assets and intensified the round-the-clock work from a Navy destroyer involved in the effort. Cmdr. William Marks, the spokesman for the U.S. Seventh Fleet, said an American P-8 Poseidon jet did a reconnaissance mission Sunday into the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The P-8, which can fly 575 miles an hour, flew about 1,200 miles out into the search area and then began looking for about four hours, Cmdr. Marks said.\\nAustralia's Chief Defense Force chief General David Hurley said Malaysian authorities coordinating the search had diverted an Australian AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft to begin searching for the plane to the north and west of the Cocos Islands, an atoll midway between Australia's west coast and Sri Lanka.\\nEstablishing definitive information about what transpired on the plane may not end even if the so-called black box is recovered. The plane's digital cockpit-voice recorder saves only the last two hours of conversation and sounds inside the cockpit, so there won't be any data going back to the instant the transponder was turned off and the plane deviated from off its original flight plan.\\nSince the 1970s, the only other instance of someone in the cockpit shutting off an onboard signaling system related to a crash was the 1997 disaster involving a SilkAir Boeing 737 in Indonesia, which killed all 104 people on the plane. NTSB investigators concluded the most likely cause was that the captain pulled a circuit breaker that disabled the flight-data recorder and cockpit-voice recorder, before deliberately sending the plane into its fatal dive from 35,000 feet. Indonesian investigators concluded the probable cause was some type of mechanical failure.\\nInvestigators have entered uncharted territory in trying to piece together what happened on Flight 370, melding information from satellite data and military data to figure out where the plane went. As that analysis began to illustrate the jet's sharp turn to the west, search teams expanded the search to into the Strait of Malacca toward the Andaman Sea, more than doubling the search area within days of the disappearance.\\nA week after the jet vanished, investigators had concluded the plane flew for more than six and a half hours from its last verified location.\\n\\u2014Gaurav Raghuvanshi and Daniel Michaels contributed to this article.\\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at and Jon Ostrower at\",\"title\":\"Search for Flight 370 Enters Daunting New Phase\",\"images\":[{\"primary\":\"true\",\"url\":\"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AI-CH358_MALTOP_G_20140317050513.jpg\"}],\"html\":\"<div class=\\\"zonedModule\\\" data-module-id=\\\"undefined\\\" data-module-name=\\\"resp.module.article.articleBody\\\">  <article class=\\\"module articleBody\\\" id=\\\"articleBody\\\" itemprop=\\\"articleBody\\\">  <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia&mdash;The search for <a class=\\\"t-company\\\" href=\\\"http://quotes.wsj.com/MY/MAS\\\">Malaysia Airlines<\\/a> <span class=\\\"article-chiclet up\\\" data-channel-currency=\\\"RM\\\" data-channel-last-price=\\\"0.235\\\" data-channel-path=\\\"\\\" data-country-code=\\\"MY\\\" data-ticker-code=\\\"MAS\\\" data-utc-offset-hours=\\\"8\\\">   <\\/span> Flight 370 expanded by thousands of miles in an operation of unprecedented scale, marked by a series of twists that have made the least likely scenarios the most credible. <\\/p> <div class=\\\"module rich-media-inset inset-group view  imageFormat-D\\\" style=\\\"border-top:0\\\"> <div class=\\\"inset-tree\\\"> <div class=\\\"inset-content inset-single-image-large\\\"> <div class=\\\"insettipUnit insetZoomTarget\\\"> <div class=\\\"inset-image-box insetZoomTargetBox\\\">  <img height=\\\"601\\\" src=\\\"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AI-CH358_MALTOP_D_20140317050513.jpg\\\" width=\\\"262\\\"><\\/img> <span class=\\\"v-assett\\\"> <a href=\\\"\\\"> <img alt=\\\"cat\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"1268\\\" src=\\\"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AI-CH358_MALTOP_G_20140317050513.jpg\\\" width=\\\"553\\\"><\\/img> <\\/a> <\\/span> <\\/div> <p class=\\\"targetCaption-video\\\"> <span class=\\\"i-credit\\\"><\\/span> <\\/p> <\\/div> <\\/div> <\\/div><\\/div> <p>The number of countries searching for the flight, which fell off radar March 8 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, doubled to roughly two dozen over the weekend. Searchers are now looking for debris more than 3,200 miles away from the point at which they believe the plane's transponders and another signaling system were deliberately turned off about an hour into the flight. <\\/p> <p>Malaysian authorities now say they believe foul play was behind the plane's vanishing, and police are investigating all crew and passengers on the flight as well as engineers who may have had contact with the aircraft before takeoff. Police searched the pilots' homes over the weekend, but Malaysia's transport ministry said there was no evidence so far linking the pilots to the plane's disappearance.<\\/p> <p>However, on Sunday, Malaysia's transport minister said key communication equipment that keeps the ground updated about the health of a flying aircraft and its engines was disabled on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 before the last recorded conversation with the cockpit.<\\/p>  <p>&quot;Yes, it was before,&quot; Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference Sunday in response to a reporter's question about whether the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, of Flight 370 was disabled before someone said, &quot;All right, good night&quot; from the cockpit. <\\/p> <p>The ACARS system being disabled before the last voice message from the cockpit backs up thinking by experts that somebody with intricate understanding of the Boeing 777-200 jet and its systems tampered with communication equipment on board. The system apparently could only have been disabled by someone in the cockpit, according to an executive of Rockwell Collins, which bought ARINC, the firm that invented the ACARS system. The executive spoke to The Wall Street Journal on condition of anonymity. <\\/p> <p>On Thursday, Mr. Hishammuddin said the last automated message was sent out by the ACARS system at 1:07 a.m. Malaysia time. But he didn't say then whether the system was disabled before or after the last comment from the cockpit. <\\/p> <p>The identity of the person making the last statement&mdash; &quot; All right, good night&quot;&mdash;hasn't been confirmed. Pilots are expected to read back important information, such as frequency change instructions, given to them by air-traffic controllers to ensure they've received the correct message, though these rules aren't always strictly followed.<\\/p> <p>The transponder signal from Flight 370 was lost at 1:21 a.m. All radar contact with the aircraft was lost a few minutes afterwards, according to Malaysian investigators. Transponders are another set of communication devices on aircraft that help identify individual flights to controllers on the ground. <\\/p>  <p>Satellite tracking suggests the plane likely traveled for hours and ended up along one of two possible corridors: one that stretches from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and the other from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.<\\/p> <p>&quot;At this stage, both the northern and southern corridors are being treated with equal importance,&quot; Malaysian Defense Minister and Acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said.<\\/p> <p>Air-safety experts said there has never been a search for remnants of an aircraft spanning such a vast area. <\\/p> <p>&quot;The enormous size of the air and sea fleet searching, and the number of countries involved&mdash;I haven't seen anything like it,&quot; said Harro Ranter, president of the Aviation Safety Network, a service that tracks air accidents.<\\/p> <p>Depending on how long the effort lasts and how extensive a region leaders of the search eventually want to cover, some early estimates are that it could end up encompassing nearly 300,000 square miles. <\\/p> <p>Air-safety investigators rely heavily on precedent to solve mysteries that surround air accidents. But in Flight 370's case normal procedures and investigative practices aren't applicable, several air-safety experts said, because the probe is focused on apparent deliberate acts by someone or a group whose motives remain unknown.

Meeting of SIA68 and MH370 occurred at 18:00UTC - 18:15UTC. MH370 dropped off of civilian radar at 17:22UTC.\\nUPDATE - Monday, March 17, 2014 - 12:15 PM EST\\nSome have raised the statement that TCAS doesn\\u2019t work if the transponder is disabled\\u2026 this is only partially correct. Other planes TCAS would NOT see MH370 at all. MH370 would not actively query other planes as its transponder is off HOWEVER it could still listen to any transponder output from other planes that are actively transmitting. SQ68 would have been actively transmitting while in-range of Subang ATC center.\\nEven if TCAS on MH370 wasn\\u2019t working for some reason, an in-expensive portable ADS-B receiver paired with an iPad and Foreflight app would allow a pilot to receive the ADS-B output being transmitted by SQ68 at that time\\nAs the search for missing flight Malaysian Airlines flight 370 drags on into the 10th day, so many questions continue to remain unanswered about how and why the airliner could have disappeared while seemingly under the control of a skilled pilot intent on making it invisible. With satellite pings showing where the plane could be after more than seven hours of flight, speculation has arisen that the plane could be on the ground anywhere along a path from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.\\nThe major roadblock to this theory has been the insistence from India and Pakistan that their radar network showed no such unidentified aircraft entering or traversing their airspace. It would seem highly unlikely given such information that a Boeing 777 could indeed slip through undetected.\\nAs a hobby pilot and aviation enthusiast, a theory began to form in my own mind on this 10th day as all of the latest information began to trickle in slowly through media outlets globally. After being unable to escape the idea that it may have happened, I began to do some analysis and research and what I discovered was very troubling to me!\\nStarting with a set of facts that have been made available publically and verified over the past few days, I first plotted MH370\\u2019s course onto an aviation IFR map which shows the airways and waypoints used to navigate the skies. I plotted the point where it stopped transmitting ADS-B information at 1721UTC. I then plotted the Malaysian military radar track from that point towards \\u201cVAMPI\\u201d, \\u201cGIVAL\\u201d, and then onward toward \\u201cIGREX\\u201d on P628 ending with where the plane should be at 1815UTC when military radar lost contact.\\nThat chart looks like this:\\nSource: SkyVector.com\\nNothing profound there\\u2026 but then I looked to see what other planes were in the air at 1815UTC and I looked to see exactly where they were positioned in the sky and where they were flying. The picture started to develop when I discovered that another Boeing 777 was en-route from Singapore over the Andaman Sea.\\nSource: FlightRadar24.com\\nI investigated further and plotted the exact coordinates of Singapore Airlines flight number 68\\u2019s location at 1815UTC onto the aviation map. I quickly realized that SIA68 was in the immediate vicinity as the missing MH370 flight at precisely the same time. Moreover, SIA68 was en-route on a heading towards the same IGREX waypoint on airway P628 that the Malaysian military radar had shown MH370 headed towards at precisely the same time.\\nSource: SkyVector.com\\nIt became apparent as I inspected SIA68\\u2019s flight path history that MH370 had maneuvered itself directly behind SIA68 at approximately 18:00UTC and over the next 15 minutes had been following SIA68. All the pieces of my theory had been fitting together with the facts that have been publically released and I began to feel a little uneasy.\\nSingapore Airlines Flight 68 proceeded across the Andaman Sea into the Bay of Bengal and finally into India\\u2019s airspace. From there it appears to have proceeded across India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and finally Turkmenistan before proceeding onward across Europe to its final destination of Barcelona, Spain.\\nThis map depicts the approximate flight path of SIA flight 68 on that particular day. Additional detail will be required from each countries aviation authorities to establish exact particulars of the route.\\nSource: SkyVector.com\\nSo by now, you may have caught on or you may be scratching your head and wondering if I\\u2019ve gone insane! How does SIA68 have anything to do with MH370 disappearing? Remember the one challenge that is currently making everyone doubt that MH370 actually flew to Turkmenistan, Iran, China, or Kyrgyzstan? That challenge is the thought that MH370 couldn\\u2019t make it through several key airspaces such as India or Afghanistan without being detected by the military.\\nIt is my belief that MH370 likely flew in the shadow of SIA68 through India and Afghanistan airspace. As MH370 was flying \\u201cdark\\u201d without transponder / ADS-B output, SIA68 would have had no knowledge that MH370 was anywhere around and as it entered Indian airspace, it would have shown up as one single blip on the radar with only the transponder information of SIA68 lighting up ATC and military radar screens.\\nWouldn\\u2019t the SIA68 flight have detected MH370? NO! The Boeing 777 utilizes a TCAS system for traffic avoidance; the system would ordinarily provide alerts and visualization to pilots if another airplane was too close. However that system only operates by receiving the transponder information from other planes and displaying it for the pilot. If MH370 was flying without the transponder, it would have been invisible to SIA68.\\nIn addition, the TCAS system onboard MH370 would have enabled the pilot(s) to easily locate and approach SIA68 over the Straits of Malacca as they appeared to have done. The system would have shown them the flight\\u2019s direction of travel and the altitude it was traveling which would have enabled them to perfectly time an intercept right behind the other Boeing 777. Here is a picture of a TCAS system onboard a 777.\\nHow does this solve the mystery??? We know MH370 didn\\u2019t fly to Spain! Once MH370 had cleared the volatile airspaces and was safe from being detected by military radar sites in India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan it would have been free to break off from the shadow of SIA68 and could have then flown a path to its final landing site. There are several locations along the flight path of SIA68 where it could have easily broken contact and flown and landed in Xingjian province, Kyrgyzstan, or Turkmenistan. Each of these final locations would match up almost perfectly with the 7.5 hours of total flight time and trailing SIA68. In addition, these locations are all possibilities that are on the \\u201cARC\\u201d and fit with the data provided by Inmarsat from the SATCOM\\u2019s last known ping at 00:11UTC.\\nThere are too many oddities in this whole story that don\\u2019t make sense if this theory isn\\u2019t the answer in my opinion. Why did MH370 fly a seemingly haphazard route and suddenly start heading northwest towards the Andaman Islands on P628? If not for this reason, it seems like a rather odd maneuver. The timing and evasive actions seem deliberate. Someone went through great lengths to attempt to become stealthy and disable ACARS, transponder/ADS-B (even though SATCOM to Inmarsat was left powered).\\nAfter looking at all the details, it is my opinion that MH370 snuck out of the Bay of Bengal using SIA68 as the perfect cover. It entered radar coverage already in the radar shadow of the other 777, stayed there throughout coverage, and then exited SIA68\\u2019s shadow and then most likely landed in one of several land locations north of India and Afghanistan.\\nSources: SkyVector.com, FlightRadar24.com, FlightAware.com, CNN.com, Reuters.com.\\n-Keith L.\\nKeithLCincy@gmail.com\\nAn update with answers to many questions has been posted at:\\nhttp://mh370shadow.com/post/80154688823/questions-answers-follow-up-1-how-did-malaysian\",\"title\":\"Did Malaysian Airlines 370 disappear using SIA68/SQ68 (another 777)?\",\"images\":[{\"primary\":\"true\",\"url\":\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/9be2d98d1e7d03d96a79bf4ceebfaad4/tumblr_inline_n2kaf7z53m1suyqf0.png\"},{\"url\":\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/5cdc5a12e843c27f9c02003098642c1d/tumblr_inline_n2kaflblZF1suyqf0.png\"},{\"url\":\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/9b781b9689a0c36b4b311b5fba8d7633/tumblr_inline_n2l0it1rMg1suyqf0.png\"},{\"url\":\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/fd223052659f40c45bb7385a3326f09a/tumblr_inline_n2kagsCjSF1suyqf0.png\"},{\"url\":\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/a0dbf4fc78d41788b3d9c66867907df1/tumblr_inline_n2kahk8eJe1suyqf0.png\"}],\"html\":\"<div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<p><strong><\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p><strong>NOTE - An update and follow-up has been posted at:<br><strong><a href=\\\"http://mh370shadow.com/post/80154688823/questions-answers-follow-up-1-how-did-malaysian\\\" title=\\\"http://mh370shadow.com/post/80154688823/questions-answers-follow-up-1-how-did-malaysian\\\"><\\/a><a href=\\\"http://mh370shadow.com/post/80154688823/questions-answers-follow-up-1-how-did-malaysian\\\">http://mh370shadow.com/post/80154688823/questions-answers-follow-up-1-how-did-malaysian<\\/a><\\/strong><\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p><strong><br>Original publish: Monday, March 17, 2014 - 12:01 AM EST<p><\\/p><\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p><strong>UPDATED: Monday, March 17, 2014 - 9:00 AM EST<br><em>Typo was made during the conversion of UTC times. &nbsp;Meeting of SIA68 and MH370 occurred at 18:00UTC - 18:15UTC. &nbsp;MH370 dropped off of civilian radar at 17:22UTC.<\\/em> &nbsp;<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p><strong>UPDATE - Monday, March 17, 2014 - 12:15 PM EST<br><em>Some have raised the statement that TCAS doesn&rsquo;t work if the transponder is disabled&hellip; this is only partially correct. &nbsp;Other planes TCAS would NOT see MH370 at all. &nbsp;MH370 would not actively query other planes as its transponder is off HOWEVER it could still listen to any transponder output from other planes that are actively transmitting. &nbsp;SQ68 would have been actively transmitting while in-range of Subang ATC center.&nbsp;<\\/em><\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p><em>Even if TCAS on MH370 wasn&rsquo;t working for some reason, an in-expensive portable ADS-B receiver paired with an iPad and Foreflight app would allow a pilot to receive the ADS-B output being transmitted by SQ68 at that time<\\/em><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>As the search for missing flight Malaysian Airlines flight 370 drags on into the 10<sup>th<\\/sup> day, so many questions continue to remain unanswered about how and why the airliner could have disappeared while seemingly under the control of a skilled pilot intent on making it invisible.

How does SIA68 have anything to do with MH370 disappearing?&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember the one challenge that is currently making everyone doubt that MH370 actually flew to Turkmenistan, Iran, China, or Kyrgyzstan?&nbsp; That challenge is the thought that MH370 couldn&rsquo;t make it through several key airspaces such as India or Afghanistan without being detected by the military. &nbsp;<\\/p>\\n<p>It is my belief that MH370 likely flew in the shadow of SIA68 through India and Afghanistan airspace.&nbsp; As MH370 was flying &ldquo;dark&rdquo; without transponder / ADS-B output, SIA68 would have had no knowledge that MH370 was anywhere around and as it entered Indian airspace, it would have shown up as one single blip on the radar with only the transponder information of SIA68 lighting up ATC and military radar screens.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Wouldn&rsquo;t the SIA68 flight have detected MH370? <\\/strong>&nbsp;NO!&nbsp; The Boeing 777 utilizes a TCAS system for traffic avoidance; the system would ordinarily provide alerts and visualization to pilots if another airplane was too close.&nbsp; However that system only operates by receiving the transponder information from other planes and displaying it for the pilot.&nbsp; If MH370 was flying without the transponder, it would have been invisible to SIA68.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n<p>In addition, the TCAS system onboard MH370 would have enabled the pilot(s) to easily locate and approach SIA68 over the Straits of Malacca as they appeared to have done.&nbsp; The system would have shown them the flight&rsquo;s direction of travel and the altitude it was traveling which would have enabled them to perfectly time an intercept right behind the other Boeing 777.&nbsp;

 "{\"text\":\"One large difference between C and most other programming languages is that in C, you have to handle memory yourself rather than having a garbage collector do it for you. Ensuring that memory is allocated at the correct moment is not very difficult (and something that needs to be done manually in pretty much every language); the hard part is to ensure that enough memory is allocated, and to ensure that the memory is deallocated when it is no longer in use.\\nThere are several techniques available for memory management in C. Many of them are used in NetHack 3.4.3; and even more are used somewhere in NetHack 4. In this blog post, I'd like to look at them and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. I'm mostly concerned about correctness, rather than efficiency, here; that means that unless the performance difference is very large, I care more about clean code than I do about fast code.\\nThere are basically two different issues here: tracking the lifetime of memory allocations, and ensuring that they're the right size. As such, I'll start by looking at allocations whose size is statically known at compile time, and then move on to techniques that can handle the size being unknown.\\nFixed-size buffers on the stack\\nProbably the simplest way to allocate memory in C is to use a stack allocation; if a variable is declared inside a function without specifying static or extern, enough memory for that variable will be allocated when that variable's scope starts, and freed again when that variable's scope ends (sometimes known as an \\\"automatic variable\\\"). Because scopes in C are well-nested, a typical C implementation will implement this via using a stack of memory; newly allocated variables will be given space from the \\\"top\\\" of the stack, and that space will be released from the top of the stack when they leave scope. (\\\"Top\\\" is in quotes because it's far from rare for a stack to be upside-down in C, with the top being the end with the lowest memory address.)\\nThere are some major advantages (and some minor advantages) of doing things this way:\\nIt does not require any extra state, beyond that provided by the implementation, to work. Quite often, memory allocation schemes will themselves need memory to work, leading to something of an infinite regress. Stack allocations are often useful to provide that memory.\\nUnlike the vast majority of memory allocation schemes, it is exception-safe with no extra effort: longjmp is aware of stack allocations, and will automatically free them from any scope it jumps out of. (Some care is needed in the function containing setjmp itself; any memory that needs to persist past a longjmp must be marked as volatile, a requirement set by the standard in order to allow compilers to optimize around longjmp calls more easily. Technically speaking, the memory does not need to be marked as volatile if its value does not change bewtween setjmp and the matching longjmp; in practice, although compilers can handle this case, they tend to spew warnings, so it makes sense to mark the memory as volatile if it is read after the longjmp at all.)\\nThis mostly does not matter in NetHack 3.4.3, which does not use any exception-like behaviour (if something goes wrong, it calls panic which attempts to produce a save file, and then exits the entire process, freeing all the memory that way). However, NetHack 4 uses exception-like behaviour internally (implemented using longjmp and setjmp, because C does not have true exceptions); NitroHack (and thus NetHack 4) uses exceptions in order to exit a game without exiting the process. From NetHack 4.3 (the current development version, which is unreleased but available using the savebreak branch of the repository) onwards, they are used even more heavily, handling situations like rewinding the game mid-turn.\\nIt works correctly in the presence of multithreading, recursion, and asynchronous signals.\\nThis technique does not require any global state apart from that managed by the C compiler; thus, it is impossible to, for instance, forget to save a variable stored in a stack allocation (unless the save code is running inside a scope containing it), or to have it accidentally persist from one game into the next.\\nIf your code does end up overflowing a fixed-sized buffer, your program is going to be incorrect no matter what, but if that buffer is allocated on the stack, it maximizes the chance that your compiler will be able to generate code to catch the buffer overflow (especially if the overflow happens in a call to a standard string manipulation function like sprintf or strcat). It is incredibly unwise to rely on this to protect your code from exploits, but it's a rather helpful feature for debugging. (Statically allocated memory is almost as good in this respect, but dynamic allocations are hopeless.)\\nIt is thus no surprise that stack allocations are used heavily in both NetHack 3.4.3 and NetHack 4. There are a couple of major disadvantages, though, which mean that this technique is not suitable for all memory:\\nThe value can only stay in scope for, at most, the length of time for which a particular function is running. In particular, this means that it's impossible for a function to stack-allocate a value, and then return a reference to it. (At least, it's impossible to do that and have the program work reliably; C lets you attempt to do so, and many compilers won't catch the attempt and will end up producing meaningless code). It is possible to work around this via returning the value itself, rather than a reference to it, but this is inefficient if the value is large, and impossible if the value internally contains pointers (e.g. in NetHack, a struct obj representing a container with contents cannot be returned from a function by any means if it was stack-allocated).\\nIt requires you to know how large the object could possibly be at compile time. In many cases, this is not very difficult (\\\"it stores the player's X coordinate, thus it can't be any larger than COLNO, thus 8 bits is enough\\\"), although even such clear-cut cases have a tendency to introduce hidden assumptions (NetHack does not run well with COLNO set to 300 rather than its default of 80, and Slash'EM Extended likewise ran into problems when it ended up with more than 256 levels simultaneously existing in one game). In other cases, NetHack just uses a value that seems as though it would be large enough.\\nAnd of course, the problem with trying to guess what value would be large enough, is that sometimes you guess wrong:\\nWhat do you want to name this scroll called named 12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012? 123456789 01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890Thank you for recording your gaming session.\u00b7\u00b7\u2502 The stored file for that session is \\\"ais523.2013-11-03-08-56-07\\\", should you care to publish it for others' entertainment. # # # \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u00b7\u2500\u2500\u2518 Abort trap ### ### # # ### ### #\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 # \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 ##\u2502\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2502 # ###\u2502\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ #\u2502\u00b7\u00b7{ ####\u2502\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2502 \u2502\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2502 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510## \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2502\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2502 ^\u00b7## \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 $Ais523 the Hatamoto St:14 Dx:15 Co:18 In:8 Wi:10 Ch:10 Lawful S:97 Dlvl:1 $:85 HP:14(15) Pw:2(2) AC:4 Xp:1/3 T:77\\nThe above is an actual screenshot (produced by using Jettyplay's HTML screenshot function on the ttyrec) of one of my games in last year's /dev/null/nethack tournament. Here's the offending code from NetHack 3.4.3:\\nchar buf[BUFSZ], qbuf[QBUFSZ]; const char *aname; short objtyp; Sprintf(qbuf, \\\"What do you want to name %s %s?\\\", is_plural(obj) ? \\\"these\\\" : \\\"this\\\", xname(obj)); getlin(qbuf, buf);\\nQBUFSZ, the amount of memory allocated to hold the prompt, is 128, so qbuf is allocated 128 characters. As can be seen from the screenshot, the prompt is well over 128 characters long (I'd intentionally caused this crash by giving the item a very long name). However, the crash did not happen straight away; the most likely reason is that qbuf overflowed into buf, which happened to be just after it on the stack, and thus the runtime system noticed nothing wrong, with the actual crash caused by an overflow due to the entire message (including my response) being more than 256 characters (BUFSZ, the most common fixed size for a string in NetHack 3.4.3); getlin assumes that its first argument is less than QBUFSZ characters when ensuring that it allocates enough memory for its own use. Of course, nothing guarantees that a buffer overflow will be caught at all, but modern operating systems are getting increasingly good at catching them because they frequently lead to security exploits. It would be unwise to rely on this in practice, though.\\nStrings are probably the largest offender in this regard in NetHack 3.4.3, although there are some overflows in various other unexpected places. For instance, filling the largest bigroom variant entirely with boulders, then attempting to travel diagonally from one end to the other, causes a crash; this is because a fixed-size buffer on the stack is used to hold the internal state of the travel logic, and although the buffer should be large enough, a bug causes boulders to be stored 64 times in the buffer, and although only a small subset of the boulders is ever stored there at a time, a sufficiently full level will nonetheless overflow the buffer. (Incidentally, I discovered this bug accidentally writing AceHack; in AceHack, changes to the travel logic meant that the bug could be triggered using lava instead of boulders, and I got a crash trying to travel in the Valkyrie quest.)\\nAlthough this technique is a useful one, and probably used for the majority of memory storage in both NetHack 3.4.3 and NetHack 4, its drawbacks mean that we need to look for other options in the cases where it fails.\\nStatic allocation\\nThis is arguably even simpler than stack allocation; write a variable outside any function, and/or use the static keyword, and it's allocated once at the start of the program and only deallocated when the program exits. (The static keyword causes the variable to have a limited scope, despite the infinite duration of its allocation; without the keyword, the compiler will make the variable anywhere in the program, including in different files, a so-called \\\"global\\\" variable. Even without the keyword, though, the variable is still considered statically allocated.)\\nThere are many situations where it's tempting to do this. Here are some of the reasons why people do:\\nIt's one of the easiest ways to solve visibility issues; if a variable is global, it only requires a quick extern declaration anywhere in the code to be able to read or write it. If there's truly only one copy of the variable, this is typically simpler and less error-prone than trying to pass pointers to it everywhere as function arguments (and what is sometimes suggested as the \\\"correct\\\" solution to the problem, dependency injection, is basically impossible to do in C due to its poor metaprogramming abilities).\\nOf course, the flip side of this is that it becomes ingrained deep into your program design that there is only one copy of that variable, and it's easy to introduce bugs by using the variable while its value is meaningless (although it's allocated for the entire program's duration, often it isn't meaningful for the entire duration). Both these problems can be alleviated to some extent by using an accessor function or macro (which is part of the reason that NetHack 4 has been introducing accessors and mutators for many globally visible variables).\\nStill, this is one of the better reasons to use a global variable.\\nIt's possible to return a reference to a statically allocated variable from a function. So long as nothing overwrites the variable until its next use, this is a method of returning large or complex (i.e. containing internal pointers) structures from functions that can actually be made to work, unlike stack allocations, which can never correctly be referenced.\\nThe downside of this is that it's extraordinarily fragile. It fails completely in the presence of multithreading or if called from signal handlers; it is very hard to get it working correctly for recursive functions; and even for regular old-fashioned function calls with nothing special about them, statements about the lifetime of the value that's returned are very hard to make, meaning that apparently innocuous changes to the code can cause major problems.\\nThis is no longer considered a legitimate reason to statically allocate variables in NetHack 4 (and increasingly, in other contexts, too; many standard POSIX functions have new versions with names ending in _r that do not attempt to use it). Some still exist because we haven't got around to getting rid of them yet, or haven't yet found a suitable replacement.\\nThe value stored in a statically allocated variable will persist until explicitly changed, even across function call boundaries.\\nThis has lead to a huge number of subtle bugs in NetHack (for instance, the way in which you can use a stethoscope for free multiple times in a turn in NetHack 3.4.3 by saving in between). The problem is that these values are typically effectively part of the gamestate, yet nothing's forcing them to be reset between one game and the next (NetHack 3.4.3 exits the process between games to help reduce this problem), or to be saved in the save file when exiting the process mid-game.\\nSo although we have some advantages here, we also have a lot of problems. One of the ongoing projects in NetHack 4 development at the moment is the \\\"globals purge\\\", where we try to get rid of global and static variables (e.g. by making them stack-allocated when possible, or replacing them with constants when possible), or at least to make them better-behaved. Here are some of the reasons we keep them around, and some of the techniques we use in order to alleviate some of their issues:\\nVariables that are global for visibility reasons typically have to be kept as global for that reason, but in NetHack 4, we namespace them into a few structs (u, flags, program_state). This means that at least we have only a few places to look to ensure that they are being saved and restored correctly. It also helps to future-proof for things like multiplayer play (you can replace the structs with arrays if there ever needs to be more than one of them, and then only have to deal with communicating the array index rather than the entire contents of the struct).\\nWhen I wrote the multiplayer patch for AceHack, global variables were one of the larger issues, given that many of them needed to be different for different players. My solution was a little extreme; I used an entire separate process for each player, meaning that each player would have their own set of global variables, and then communicated all the data that needed to be shared via passing save files around between processes every action. This might seem backwards and wasteful, but it was easier to track all the shared data (using the save file), than it was to track the various random information stored in globals! For NetHack 4, I'm hoping that a multiplayer patch would not need to resort to such extreme lengths.\\nSome functions legitimately need to preserve their state for a short time, communicating it to other functions or to future invocations of the same function, but not to need to place it in the save file. An example that caused us trouble for a while was the state used while praying; you start praying, and three turns later the prayer finishes. The game needs to decide whether the prayer is receptive or not when you start praying, because it effects whether you are invulnerable or not, but cannot repeat the calculation at the end (e.g. because your prayer timeout might have dropped from +1 to \u22122 during those three turns), and so needs to remember the value across those three turns.\\nIt's impossible to save while praying in NetHack 3.4.3; in NetHack 4.3, it's possible to save at any time (in order to handle hangup correctly), but this is accomplished via remembering the gamestate the last time it could safely be saved (i.e. not during prayer), and the character's actions since, and replaying them upon reload (or reverting if changes to the code mean they can't be replayed). Thus, the prayer state never needs to appear in the save file.\\nIn NetHack 4, we've introduced a struct turnstate for this sort of variable. In order to use the turnstate mechanism, the code must ensure that there is no attempt to calculate the gamestate portion of the save file while turnstate variables have non-default values, putting them back to their defaults once the player regains control of their character. The turnstate values are repeatedly checked to ensure that this is the case; as a result, any values in turnstate cannot end up bypassing the save/reload system (and we get a useful debug message if some broken code attempts to do this).\\nRotating buffers\\nThis is a trick that's sometimes used to work around one of the problems with static variables: returning them from functions gives them a lifetime that's hard to determine, and sometimes too short. The idea is to have an array of static variables, that are used in sequence, cycling back to the first once the last is used.\\nThe result is a variable that works almost entirely like a static variable in terms of its properties as a return value. Its lifetime is still basically impossible to determine, but longer than it would be otherwise. The code then simply hopes it's long enough (or to put it more kindly, ensures that the return value from the function is copied somewhere safe before the function is called another n times).\\nThis technique is used by NetHack 3.4.3 to handle strings returned from object naming functions (which are often built up out of other strings returned by object naming functions), mediated by the function nextobuf. To make things even more confusing, some of the object naming functions assume that the return values from other functions were constructed like this (an assumption that is not documented anywhere), and take the opportunity to alter them in-place.\\nWith respect to object naming functions in particular, this technique has another problem; given that the buffers are fixed size, they can overflow if a sufficiently long object name is used. I'm not sure what the longest possible object name is, but it's got to be quite close to 256 characters.\\nI haven't yet ripped this mess out of NetHack 4, but I want to. Part of the reason I'm writing this blog post is to give me a nice list of strategies I could potentially replace it with, to help me decide what the correct fix is.\\nSingle dynamic allocation with ownership semantics\\nThere is one other place where memory can be allocated in C; instead of placing it on the stack, or statically allocating it, it can be allocated using malloc, which obtains a block of memory of a given size in some system-specific manner (e.g. one common mechanism is to find some free space in a single large resizable block of memory known as the \\\"heap\\\", making it larger if necessary; there are others).\\nThe concept of single dynamic allocation is quite simple: you need a variable of a particular size, and so you just create it with a call to malloc when you need it. This neatly gets around all the problems with the previous methods, because the memory will persist as long as you need it, and won't be overwritten except if you explicitly overwrite it.\\nInstead, the problem with this method is getting rid of the memory again when you no longer need it. There's a standard function free that releases an allocation made using malloc, but knowing when to call it can be difficult. The most common method of doing this is \\\"ownership semantics\\\"; whenever a pointer to dynamic memory gets passed around, part of the API is whether the ownership of the pointer is being passed (in which case the recipient is responsible for freeing it and the sender cannot keep copies), or whether the sender keeps the ownership (in which case the sender remains responsible for freeing it and the recipient cannot keep copies nor pass the ownership on itself).\\nThis would seem to be a nicely simple and general method of handling fixed-size memory. However, there are a few reasons why it is not used everywhere:\\nIt's a bunch of typing; it's much easier to write\\n{ struct obj otmp; /* do stuff with otmp */ }\\nthan it is to write\\n{ struct obj *otmp; otmp = malloc(sizeof *otmp); /* do stuff with otmp */ free(otmp); }\\nAnd of course, the latter code needed to do a stack allocation anyway in order to store the address of the memory it allocated.\\nThis is pretty minor, but in cases where stack and dynamic allocations are otherwise equally good, there's no real reason to do the dynamic allocation at all; it just makes your code harder to read.\\nIt is hard, in C, to make sure that your ownership semantics are being tracked correctly; if you make a mistake, often apparently nothing will go wrong, but your program is now incorrect (either in terms of a use-after-free, a double-free, or simply just leaking memory). There are other languages that aim to solve this problem (notably Rust, although various C++ libraries go a good way towards being able to solve it too), but converting NetHack's codebase to a new language would be very difficult (even one as similar as C++, which has many potentially relevant details that differ from C).\\nThere are also program analyzers that are meant to be able to catch memory allocation mistakes. splint is designed to do this but requires many changes to the program and turns out to be unusably buggy in practice. valgrind works excellently, but works on a running program, and thus can only catch issues that you actually trigger in your test run; additionally, in the case of a memory leak, it can determine where the allocation was, but not where the free should have been.\\nHowever, the largest reason I've been moving away from the most naive version of dynamic allocation in NetHack 4 is exception safety. In C++, the use of RAII means that exceptions can be made to free any dynamically allocated objects whose owners went out of scope as a result of the exception. In C, we don't easily have that option available to us, and those objects are just going to stay allocated. As a result, when short-lived dynamically allocated objects are used in NetHack 4, we have to ensure that it's impossible to have an exception while the object is alive (which means, for instance, the code cannot make any attempts to get user input; a problem, because constructing prompts to show to the user is one of the situations you'd otherwise want to use dynamic allocation for).\\nHere's an amusing example of this technique in use, new to the NetHack 4 codebase:\\ncase OPTTYPE_KEYMAP: str = malloc(1 + sizeof \\\"submenu\\\"); strcpy(str, \\\"submenu\\\"); return str;\\nWhy not just return the string \\\"submenu\\\"? Because the function in question can return strings from a range of different sources. That one's a compile-time constant, but not all of them have the luxury of being able to return compile-time constants. For instance, another possibility is for the return value to be the ASCII representation of a number; the code for that prints it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, then makes a dynamically allocated copy of it so as to be able to return it from a function.\\nThis case of creating text for the current values of options on the option menu is a perfect scenario for ownership semantics because the text simply has to be calculated, added to the menu, and then can be freed again (a few lines later, before we've lost track of the owner of the text); yet a stack allocation would be awkward due to the way the code flow in the section works. In most cases, things aren't that simple due to the possibility of exceptions and the lifetime of the object being longer (and thus harder to track). Thus, despite being hugely widespread in most C codebases, this is relatively rarely used in the NetHack 4 codebase.\\nAllocation on chains\\nThis is a technique used in both the NetHack 3.4.3 and NetHack 4 codebases in order to gain the advantages of dynamic allocation, while dodging many of the disadvantages. The basic idea is for all objects of a particular sort to be stored on an \\\"allocation chain\\\" (typically most easily implemented as a linked list whose metadata is part of the objects themselves, although any method of implementing a set would work); they're placed on a chain when allocated (there can be, and often is, more than one), and removed when freed. Any of the other memory management techniques in C can be used to track the chain itself (for instance, it could be a global variable, or possibly even stack allocated).\\nFor this technique to work properly, the code needs to know points in time at which the chains should be empty (otherwise there's no real benefit to tracking them); this is the main restriction on this technique.\\nIt works pretty well, though, when that restriction is not an issue:\\nIt enables the code to monitor its allocations at runtime, making double-frees and memory leaks detectable (although not use-after-frees). While not as good as a compile-time guarantee, it's nonetheless helpful in catching errors in practice. (Incidentally, this check is responsible for what is probably NetHack 4's record number of panics in a day, trying to iron out bugs I'd introduced converting the item code to be fully allocation-chain based.)\\nIt can handle exceptions (i.e. longjmp), just so long as after the jump, it's possible to determine, by analyzing objects on the chains, whether they should be allocated or not (the ones that shouldn't be get deallocated). Typically this is via arranging things such that the chains are supposed to be empty after an exception, meaning that anything that's found on the chains can be freed.\\nNetHack 3.4.3 uses an approximation of this technique for handing items (although probably for a different reason than memory safety). Each item is on one of a large number of chains; many are gamestate (e.g. \\\"the chain containing the possessions of \u00abmonster\u00bb\\\"). In NetHack 4, there are also chains for turnstate, and for items that are currently being moved around between locations (in case an exception happens after an object's been removed from one gamestate chain and before it's been placed on another; the length of time during which an item is on no chain is just a few lines, which can easily be checked to ensure they can't cause exceptions); getting that to correctly handle unusual situations (such as stacks being split or items being polymorphed) is what caused all the panics.\\nThis technique's used in other places in NetHack 4, too. A good example is the menu code in the interface. NetHack 4 avoids a hard limit on the number of menus that can be drawn on the screen at once, meaning that a static buffer is unusable, and because menus need to move on the screen when the screen is resized (which could happen with any number of menus open), stack allocation would be awkward for visibility reasons. Instead, a statically allocated menu chain is used, holding currently open menus. It is possible to need to quit the current game with menus open (currently only due to hangup, but I'm planning to add a \\\"save anywhere\\\" feature before 4.3 is released), causing an exception. However, the game can deallocate the menus because exceptions in NetHack 4 always work by jumping back to a known state (just before the game was loaded) and replaying from there, and thus it's known that no menus should be on the screen, and they can all be removed.\\nFinally, a cautionary tale. NitroHack has an allocation chain for objects being communicated over the API from the server to the client. It's freed every turn. This loses most of the benefits of allocation chains, and makes it very difficult for the client to work out the lifetimes of the objects it receives (especially as there's no guarantee that there's even a game running, so the concept of \\\"turn\\\" may be meaningless). In NetHack 4, I changed it to be freed with every API call, which effectively works the same way as returning a static buffer from the client's point of view. This is better, but still unsatisfactory, really; perhaps I'll find a better option someday. The moral of the story is that allocation chains do not magically solve all the issues with dynamic allocation; sometimes they're appropriate, but sometimes you need to find something else.\\nReference counting\\nNo discussion of memory management in C would be complete without a mention of one of the most general methods for dealing with it. Instead of having one owner for an object, as in ownership semantics, you allow any number of owners for each object, and keep a count on the object of how many owners it has. When an owner no longer cares about an object, it decreases the count, and deallocates it if the count became 0. This is basically just a generalization of ownership semantics; it does nothing to help with exceptions, because you cannot know whether the reference count is correct or not after an exception.\\nThere are some sorts of programs where reference counting is very useful; in particular, the sorts of programs most suited to functional programming (such as parsers, compilers, and other programs that mess with abstract syntax trees) often are best implemented using immutable objects that each hvae multiple owners, rather than giving each owner their own mutable copy. NetHack is, however, not really that sort of program, and there are few situations in which the power of reference counting is needed. (Arguably, it would even hurt; the most famous situation in which reference counting breaks down is reference cycles, and there are quite a few of those in the item handling code, albeit with clear rules for breaking cycles using weak references.)\\nThere is one case where reference counting is used in NetHack 4; the (external) JSON parser library supports reference counting for JSON objects, and thus NetHack 4 is forced to interface with that. As far as I know, though, it isn't used for anything other than emulating a single-owner semantics but with more boilerplate.\\nCaller allocates\\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the big problems with stack allocations is that they're not particularly useful for returning values from functions, and using static buffers for the purpose is a bad idea. Sometimes you can avoid the problems using dynamic allocation (\\\"callee allocates\\\"); but as seen above, that has its own issues.\\nOne widespread solution to this problem is to have the caller do the allocation itself, then tell the function it's calling where it wants the return value to be placed. The callee thus has the memory it needs to write in already, and doesn't need to worry about its lifetime; that's the caller's job.\\nSo long as the caller knows how large the memory it needs to allocate is at compile time, there are very few downsides to doing things this way. Any sort of allocation the callee could do, the caller can do too, and the caller has a better idea of what lifetime the data needs than the callee does. Additionally, there are two things that the caller can do that the callee couldn't; it can allocate objects on the stack using its own lifetime (which is very useful if it's planning to use them itself rather than return them to some other function); and it can use storage that was allocated by its caller, and so on ad infinitum.\\nThe problem, of course, is that the caller absolutely needs to know the size of the object that's going to be returned to it, or it has no way to allocate an object large enough (other than guessing, which is prone to failure). For objects that inherently tend to have a variable length, such as strings, this doesn't work so well. The most infamous example is gets, which was once a standard C function; its purpose is to return a string from standard input, with no length limit. Given that the only way for gets's caller to be completely sure of how much memory to allocate would be if it had placed the string on standard input itself, defeating the whole point of the system call, it quickly became apparent that all useful uses of gets were security vulnerabilities, and the function was subsequently removed from the standard.\\nIt is perhaps unfortunate, then, that NetHack 3.4.3 uses caller-allocates mostly for strings, one of the least suited sorts of data for the technique. There's a convention that the amount of space to allocate is BUFSZ (256), and callees are therefore supposed to check this to make sure that they don't overflow the caller's buffer, but the code usually seems to forget the check in practice.\\nExamples of better uses include coordinate handling code, such as dtoxy in NetHack 3.4.3 (that asks the caller to allocate a pair of coordinates), and arg_from_delta in NetHack 4 (which fills in an nh_cmd_arg structure provided by the caller; the function's purpose is to convert a direction given as x/y/z coordinates into a structure used to remember the context of a user's command so that it can be repeated correctly with control-A).\\nSo far, we've been looking at techniques that only work when the size of the object we're trying to allocate is known at compile time. Those are, unfortunately, the easy ones, despite there being such a range of possibilities to handle it. If it isn't known how large the object will be, things can get a lot worse.\\nVariable length arrays\\nVariable length VLAs are a feature added to C in C99, and thus often considered a \\\"new\\\" feature even though C99 was released approximately 15 years ago. (Something similar to VLAs, yet which works on many older compilers, is alloca, which is not defined in the C standards but is nonetheless a commonly provided extension. It doesn't mix well with VLAs, though.) The idea is pretty simple: if a C implementation uses a stack for handling automatic variables, then it can allocate a variable amount of memory as easily as a fixed amount of memory, so why shouldn't that capability be available to user programs?\\nThe big advantage of VLAs is that you get all the advantages of stack allocations, except now you don't need to know how large your object is at compile time, so long as you know how large it is some time before you need to allocate it. VLAs are used heavily in code newly written for NetHack 4, as a result; in particular, the exception safety of stack allocations is something that is often much more awkward to gain any other way.\\nIn fact, pretty much our only answer to \\\"why aren't you just using a VLA\\\" is \\\"we can't\\\":\\nAlthough not as odious a requirement as knowing the size of the allocation at compile time, it's often still impossibe to know the size of the object even at the time you try to allocate it. For instance, not even VLAs will make gets work. Many of the following sections will be discussing various workarounds to this.\\nVLAs are still stack allocations, and so they still can't have a lifetime larger than the function that allocates them. So they're still useless for returning values from functions.\\nThese problems both come up surprisingly often in practice.\\nBuffer bumping\\nJust as VLAs are the variable-length version of stack allocations, \\\"buffer bumping\\\" is my name for the variable-length version of static allocations. (I'm not sure if there's an official or widely-used one.) This is seen quite widely in NitroHack code; I'm not aware of it being used in NetHack 3.4.3. I've mostly got rid of it for NetHack 4, usually via finding a way to avoid static allocations entirely, although it is nonetheless appropriate in some cases (such as the \\\"Things that are here:\\\" display in the interface, which needs to be global for visibility reasons; being part of the interface, there's no need to worry about ensuring that it ends up in the save file).\\nThe basic idea is to have a statically allocated pointer, initially NULL. Whenever you want to write to the static storage in question, you check to ensure it's allocated and large enough. If it isn't, you reallocate it larger (free followed by malloc is the most efficient way to do this if you don't care about its old contents; realloc copies the contents over from the old location to the new larger location, and thus is useful if the old contents are still relevant). Thus, the buffer never actually gets smaller, and ends up still allocated at the end of the program, at which point it's deallocated by the operating system. A variation is to resize the memory smaller at any point where less of it is needed, or perhaps deallocate it altogether (setting the variable back to NULL) once it's no longer relevant; this is probably marginally slower and probably marginally less wasteful of memory, but the size of both changes tends to be so small that it's very unlikely it would make a difference in practice.\\nOne nice advantage of this method is that you don't need to know the size of the object you're storing in advance; you can bump the buffer halfway through filling it if you have to.\\nThere are some problems with doing things this way:\\nIn addition to the standard advantages of static allocation, you have all the standard drawbacks of static allocation, too. You can have a better idea of when the value is meaningful (perhaps making errors in resetting it easier to detect), but that's about it; you still have the uncertainty about lifetimes, and the issues with ensuring that the variable is saved correctly.\\nThese disadvantages can be mitigated the same way as they can be mitigated with regular statically allocated variables.\\nThere's also a new problem, though. With statically allocated variables, if you pass pointers to them around, those pointers will at least remain valid forever. Buffer bumping, because it resizes memory, can sometimes end up giving it a new address; I hope nobody was saving a pointer to it! Worse, the new address is usually but not always the same as the old one, making this difficult to debug, because simple tests will normally not notice a problem, and tests that do observe a problem may fail to reproduce it.\\nThis can be worked around using an extra layer of indirection, passing around a pointer to the statically allocated pointer itself rather than to the memory it points to, but the code gets increasingly hard to read and maintain as a result.\\nYou could theoretically do this for rotating buffers, too. That might arguably be an improvement on the current object naming code, but the result would be both hideous and massively fragile.\\nDynamic reallocation\\nThis is the standard method for dealing with data of an unknown size. You start off with just a small dynamic allocation (or sometimes even an effective 0-byte allocation using a null pointer); and keep track of how much memory is allocated, in addition to tracking a pointer to the memory itself. Then you start doing whatever calculations you need to do in order to construct the object itself. If you ever find there isn't enough memory, you just make it larger, using realloc to copy the old contents over.\\nFor performance reasons, it helps to resize the object in large steps rather than small steps; reallocating it one byte larger every time round a loop can lead to quadratic performance. When the expected sizes are large, reallocations typically multiply the allocated size by a factor (often 2 or 1.5), in order to ensure that the performance remains linear no matter what. When the expected sizes are small, you can simply round up to a multiple of some number that's larger than commonly expected sizes, and have efficiency in the common case and code that continues to work even in the rare cases where you're dealing with more data than expected. Here's an example from the NetHack 4 codebase (this is part of a strcat implementation for dynamically reallocated memory, quite similar to StringBuilder in Java):\\nif (strlen_first + strlen_second >= *first_alloclen) { int first_was_null = !*first; *first_alloclen = ((strlen_first + strlen_second + 1) / 256) * 256 + 256; *first = realloc(*first, *first_alloclen); if (first_was_null) **first = 0; }\\nThe code has to handle both first_alloclen and first itself; it also needs to maintain a NUL terminator on first, because strcat works on NUL-terminated strings.\\nThe advantages of this technique:\\nIf dynamic allocation is appropriate for whatever you're doing (in NetHack 4, that normally means code that's entirely about calculation and doesn't cross the client/server boundary or do communication with the user), then all you have to do is add an extra variable to store the allocation length (stored the same way as your pointer), and your reallocations will work fine. This is especially useful if you would be using dynamic allocation anyway, but stack allocations are not hard to convert if their exception-related properties aren't needed.\\nIt works quite neatly with caller-allocates; so long as you can require the caller to do a dynamic allocation, and add an extra level of indirection to the call, you can have the callee do the reallocation. (This is what's going on with the *first and *first_alloclen in the code sample above.) That said, if the callee can do reallocation, there often isn't much need to make the caller do the original allocation; the main benefit is if you need mutiple callees to do reallocations on the same buffer.\\nThe disadvantage, of course, is that you're doing a dynamic allocation. Even when you can use ownership semantics (which is \\\"usually but not always\\\"), it's not always possible to guarantee that your allocation won't end up leaking due to an exception. As such, this technique is not that widely used in NetHack 4, although it does show up occasionally.\\nCount and copy\\nUsing a caller-allocates system has several advantages, but one big disadvantage: the caller has to know the size of allocation to perform. However, there is one way in which it can frequently find out: ask the function which is eventually going to fill the buffer it allocates.\\nThe basic idea of count-and-copy is to provide functions with an argument that specifies whether to count the size of their output, or to copy their output into a provided buffer (conveniently, the argument can be the buffer itself, setting it to NULL to represent a count). This works particularly well when an entire call hierarchy uses it, because the callee can go and ask the functions it calls how much data they plan to return, and use it to determine how much data it will return, without needing to actually generate the data itself. In the most appropriate situations for count-and-copy, the count can be very fast, and thus not cause much of an efficiency loss (or in extreme circumstances even an efficiency gain) compared to dynamic reallocation; and it can achieve this with all the advantages of caller-allocates at the same time! (Most likely, the caller will use a VLA to do the allocation, although it could allocate dynamically if it want to, or even use buffer-bumping.)\\nCount-and-copy is not so good if the callee needs to effectively calculate the object it's going to return just to be able to determine how large it is, and it's horrific if the callee needs to allocate memory to be able to calculate that. As such, it isn't a technique that's appropriate in all situations. It also suffers from longer code than some other techniques, and potentially repetitive code too (you have to call a function twice to use it, and the two calls cannot be wrapped in a function because that would mess up the scope of the object being allocated).\\nThis technique turns up in an unusual place in NetHack 3.4.3: the game save code. This is particularly unexpected because unlike in NetHack 4, the save code in 3.4.3 does not have a return value apart from \\\"the save worked, exit the game\\\" or \\\"the save failed, keep playing\\\"; the save file itself is written to disk. However, NetHack is even older than C99 (in fact, even older than C89), and dates from an era when hard disks might not be installed and floppy disks were pretty small; there was a real risk that the save file would fail to fit on the remaining space on the drive, and thus counting the amount of available space before copying onto the disk ensured that the save would not fail halfway through (perhaps corrupting the gamestate in the process, because the save code is also responsible for memory deallocation in that version).\\nA more typical example is the vsnprintf function from the C standards (which libuncursed, a rendering library I wrote for NetHack 4, uses to interpret its equivalent of a printf statement). There's a vsprintf function that uses a caller-allocates system, but although the caller sometimes knows the maximum length that can be produced from a given format string, libuncursed would have to reproduce much of the logic of printf to be able to work it out for an arbitrary format string provided by its users. vsnprintf uses a count-and-copy interface instead, allowing libuncursed to determine how large a buffer it needs to provide for the next call to vsnprintf.\\nSadly, it turns out that the version of vsnprintf available in the C toolchain for Windows that I'm using is buggy; it returns an error code, rather than the buffer size, if the buffer is absent or too small, which is behaviour forbidden by the standard. Thus, in libuncursed, I had to write a loop that detects this situation and tries successively larger buffers until the correct buffer size is determined. I guess that's better than gets, at least\\u2026\\nCallee-cleans\\nSometimes, you have no option but to use dynamic reallocation for obtaining the memory for your object. For instance, NetHack creates a lot of menus, often with a range of different functions responsible for adding various items to the menu; and although count-and-copy is theoretically usable for that, the code would become something of a mess, especially as counting menu items is often quite inefficient.\\nHowever, menus cannot be dynamically allocated either; the lack of exception-safety is a problem, because \\\"showing a menu to the user\\\" is a particularly likely situation to get an exception. Not only is it both possible, and reasonable in practice, to get a hangup there, but if the menu needs to be closed asynchronously without user interaction, NetHack 4 implements that with exceptions too (for instance, this can happen if you're watching someone else's game and they close a menu).\\nAlthough the situation seems unsolvable (or worse, solvable using global variables), there is a solution, albeit a reasonably absurd one. Here's the relevant part of NetHack 4's menu code:\\n/* Make a stack-allocated copy of the menulist, in case we end up longjmping out of here before we get a chance to deallocate it. */ struct nh_menuitem item_copy[ml->icount ? ml->icount : 1]; if (ml->icount) memcpy(item_copy, ml->items, sizeof item_copy); /* ... some other initialization goes here ... */ dealloc_menulist(ml); /* ... main body of the function goes here ... */\\nThe idea is reasonably simple. From the caller's point of view, the API is simply \\\"you pass a dynamically allocated object, and transfer ownership to the callee\\\". The callee responds by copying the object into a VLA, and then freeing the original (which it can do, because it has ownership); thus, by the time the code reaches the point at which exceptions can happen, the dynamically allocated memory is long gone.\\nOne potential alternative is to make the caller do the copying into a VLA. That is slightly more general, in that it allows the caller to have access to the object after the call is over (in the typical case when there was no exception). However, it's much worse in terms of code duplication, because a VLA is needed at every callsite rather than merely in the function being called.\\nDespite performing its job well, I avoid this approach in NetHack 4 unless the alternatives are even worse; copying an object purely for the purpose of moving it from the heap to the stack is wasteful in the vast majority of cases.\\nAs can be seen above, memory allocation in C is something of a mess, and there is no simple and general solution that works for everything. (This is, incidentally, one of the reasons why C is famous for being more efficient than other languages; in other languages, it's the compiler managing the memory, not you, and being a computer and thus uncreative it will inevitably attempt to use the same solution for everything, or at least choose from a relatively small set.)\\nSometimes it's simplest to dodge the problem. Obviously, doing that is not always possible. In this section, we consider some methods that can be used the rest of the time.\\nUsing indexes into lookup tables\\nSometimes, you need to pass an argument to a function, or return a value from a function, but there are only a finite number of possible values. If the number is both finite and small, then it can make a lot of sense to have an explicit list, and simply pass an index into that list.\\nThis is most commonly done with strings. If you don't have to allocate the memory for a string, its variable-length nature is not a problem. Instead of returning memory which is allocated for the purpose of holding a string, you can just return a pointer to the tring in the program's data section itself; the pointer is effectively an index into your program's memory image. Of course, this only works when all the possible return values are known in advance, or (if you're prepared to handle the lifetime headaches) static buffers.\\nA good example of this in the NetHack codebase is the hcolor function, whose purpose is to return a nonexistent color to hallucinating players, and a default color to players who are not suffering from hallucination. Thus, a black object would be described as hcolor(\\\"black\\\"); normally this would just be \\\"black\\\", but when hallucinating, it might be \\\"bluish-orange\\\" or \\\"sky blue-pink\\\".\\nThe function's general behaviour might require a static buffer or dynamic allocation if it did something more complex, but because the list of nonexistent colors is hard-coded, and the default color is also hard-coded by each caller, there's no need for messing about with memory allocation at all; the caller can just provide a constant string as the argument, and get one in return.\\nThis technique can also be used with things other than strings; monster descriptions are one common example (in fact, the game normally works out which species a monster belongs to by converting the pointer to its monster description back into an index, relying on the fact that it's just a pointer into an array rather than allocated memory and that C is one of the very few languages that allows pointer arithmetic).\\nContinuation passing style\\nAs can be seen above, the most difficult case for handling memory allocations is in function return values; stack allocations are the best general-purpose allocations, but have lifetime issues that prevent them being returned from functions. However, frequently the only thing the caller does with the return value from a function is to pass it to another function.\\nThis suggests an alternative style of return value passing; instead of the callee trying to pass the return value back to the caller, the caller can instead tell the callee what it wants to do next with the return value. This is known as continuation passing style, or CPS. Here's a hypothetical example:\\n/* Without CPS */ char foo[7] = \\\"foo\\\"; strcat(foo, \\\"bar\\\"); puts(foo); /* With CPS */ cps_strcat(\\\"foo\\\", \\\"bar\\\", puts);\\nIn the first version of the code, the caller needed to allocate a buffer to hold the concatenation of \\\"foo\\\" and \\\"bar\\\", so that it could pass it to puts; and it would be very easy to get the size of the buffer wrong. The CPS version is much simpler; the \\\"foobar\\\" needs to be allocated somewhere, but it's most likely going to be a stack allocation or dynamic reallocation somewhere inside cps_strcat, which at least has the benefit of being able to look at its own internals to measure the size of the resulting string. Then once it's produced the string, it passes it on to puts.\\nIt should be noted that the allocations could be avoided altogether if some other representation were used for the strings. C typically uses a sequence of characters contiguous in memory. If instead, for instance, a string were represented by a loop that calls an arbitrary (passed-in) function once for each character in the string, no variable-length allocations would be needed in the above example. That representation is very alien to C programmers, though, and has effectively no library support; additionally, although it works well for strcat, it can struggle doing more complex string optimizations. (Incidentally, I first saw it in an embedded system with less than a kilobyte of memory, and no ability to dereference pointers to ROM. Storing strings in RAM would have been wasteful, so it used that string representation in order to fit the string into ROM while simultaneously allowing arbitrary operations to be performed on the string.)\\nThe CPS technique is very widely used in implementing functional languages, but it falls down somewhat in C. The main issue is the lack of closures, meaning that an annoying number of extra levels of indirection need to be used in order to be able to pass extra arguments to the function that is given the return value. (Although gcc supports stack-allocated closures as an extension, this is not portable to C compilers in general.) The most promising solution to this is to come up with a kind of domain-specific language for describing what to do with function return values (much the same way as printf has a domain-specific language for its format strings). As such, the technique seems most useful when it is only used across a small group of callees, which all co-operate. (Can you tell I'm strongly considering trying to use this approach for constructing messages to be shown to the user in NetHack 4? Whether I do or not will likely depend on how readable the resulting code is and how much effort converting the existing code will take.)\\nCPS is also useless at storing values long-term. You might be able to construct a string to show as a message that way, but it's never going to work as a method of storing strings in a save file.\\nOne other thing to note is that unlike in functional language implementations, in C, you do not want to use continuation passing style everywhere; especially if a function has a simple return value (such as an integer), you want it to return normally. The reason is that a continuation passing style \\\"return\\\" is not a return from C's point of view, and thus does not free stack allocations. This is fine and desirable for what you use CPS for, but if there are no normal returns involved, nothing on the stack will ever be deallocated, and your program is effectively just one giant memory leak.\\nCall-by-name evaluation\\nCPS is useful for avoiding the need to allocate memory in a way that can be returned from a function, at the cost of forcing the memory to be made suitable for use as an argument instead. The noticeable feature here is that the return value is replaced with a callback. The same technique can be applied to the arguments; instead of allocating memory to serve as a function argument, you instead supply a callback that can be used to obtain the argument. This is known as the \\\"call by name\\\" convention; some programming languages (e.g. Algol 60) actually use it by default (the compiler constructs the callbacks transparently without needing user interaction), but it can be emulated in \\\"call by value\\\" languages like C.\\nThe main disadvantage of call-by-name is that it is often inefficient in practice, and can be hard to reason about. However, it has a couple of advantages for practical use: it is up to the callee whether the argument is ever evaluated at all (meaning that dead code can be eliminated dynamically at runtime), and more importantly, there is never a need to store the value of an argument anywhere. (My day job is actually involved with call-by-name compiler design; it has additional advantages when reasoning about programs, because control structures like if and while cannot be expressed as call-by-value functions but can be expressed as call-by-name functions, meaning that fewer special cases are needed to be able to reason about arbitrary programs.)\\nFor the purposes of this blog post, what we're really interested in is the way in which the use of call-by-name gets around the need for temporaries to store data. Here's some code from the current NetHack 4 codebase, that prints a message when an object breaks, reminding the player that they can name it even after it's broken (unlike NetHack 3.4.3, which prompts for a name immediately because the player will not have a chance to name it later):\\nchar buf[BUFSZ]; /* ... */ else sprintf(buf, \\\"(You can name %s from the item naming menu.)\\\", an(xname(&otemp))); pline(\\\"%s\\\", buf);\\nThe current version of this code uses a bunch of fixed-size temporaries; we have buf declared to hold the output of sprintf, but an and xname also need temporaries for their return value (they use a shared rotating buffer, at current). Thus there's a lot of data storage required. (This code is a little inefficient even given its memory allocation style: it could be simplified by simply replacing the sprintf calls with pline calls, avoiding the need for buf, but still requiring storage from an and xname. That would avoid the need for the doubled-up formatted prints.)\\nImagine what this code would look like in call-by-name:\\nstruct cbn_string *buf; /* ... */ else buf = strcat3(\\\"(You can name \\\", an(xname(&otemp)), \\\"from the item naming menu.)\\\"); pline(buf);\\nThe code is pretty similar from the point of view of the caller, which is a huge advantage, but would work very differently from the point of view of actual control flow. The buf = line isn't doing any calculations immediately; instead, it's building up a data structure. In this case, strcat3, an, and xname would be macros that create a structure that describes the string to evaluate, probably expanding to something like the following C99 code:\\nbuf = &(struct cbn_strcat3){ CBN_STRCAT, &(struct cbn_literal){CBN_LITERAL, \\\"(You can name \\\"}, &(struct cbn_an){CBN_AN, &(struct cbn_xname){CBN_XNAME, &otemp}}, &(struct cbn_literal){CBN_LITERAL, \\\"%s from the item naming menu.)\\\"}};\\nWe now have a data structure that describes which object naming functions need to be called, with hardly any change in the original code (our only change was to replace sprintf, which takes a variable number of arguments and thus is very difficult to handle via macros, with a hypothetical strcat3 that concatenates exactly three strings). Then, \\\"all\\\" pline has to do is to evaluate this structure into an actual string so as to be able to show it to the user. (We use a data structure as the callback, rather than a C function, because C is bad at creating closures.) Thus, this technique does not get rid of the problems with passing data around entirely; the implementations of an and xname will still need to handle the strings somehow. It does, however, localize the problem of memory handling to within the object naming functions, removing the need to manage memory manually from all the places that call them.\\nThere are some drawbacks to this approach, though. One is efficiency; call-by-name is noticeably slower than call-by-value on every benchmark I've tried (especially because copying a name means you end up evaluating it twice, as opposed to copying a value that has already been evaluated). Another is that the sugar given above requires some pretty modern compilers to work properly; although the result of expanding the macros works in C99, and thus should be supported by any compiler less than ten years old or so (although surprisingly many compilers don't care about C99 support), actually writing the macros themselves needs C11 support so that they can distinguish a pointer from a string literal. C11 is less than three years old right now, and support for _Generic, the required feature, just isn't there in practice; the version of gcc in my distribution's repositories does not recognise the keyword at all, and clang compiles it correctly, but produces incorrect warning messages, making development awkward.\\nThe other thing to note is that the sugar given above constructs the names themselves on the stack; they have a fixed size known at compile time, so that isn't an issue, but attempting to return them from a function will fail. As a result, any function that would return a name has to be converted to call-by-name itself, and so the style rather tends to infect its callers, meaning that it can be a major change to a program.\\nFinally, just like CPS, this method tends not to work for storing data in a save file. Unlike with CPS, it's entirely possible to work out a method to save a name; the problem is that if the data needs saving at all, the name is not enough information to reproduce it. Something like getlin, which prompts for a string from the user, is very unsuitable for call-by-name, because there would be a new prompt for a string every time it were needed, rather than remembering the string that the user gave last time.\\nNeither CPS nor call-by-name are used in NetHack 4 (although the rendering library does something vaguely similar to call-by-name in order to remove code that's unnecessary on the terminal in use, such as converting characters to UTF-8 on a non-Unicode terminal). Although I'm considering using them in places that particularly benefit, this work is still highly experimental right now, and unlikely to appear in 4.3.\",\"title\":\"Memory management in C programs\",\"html\":\"<div>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One large difference between C and most other programming languages is\\nthat in C, you have to handle memory yourself rather than having a\\ngarbage collector do it for you.

Here's\\nthe offending code from NetHack 3.4.3:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>char buf[BUFSZ], qbuf[QBUFSZ];\\nconst char *aname;\\nshort objtyp;\\n\\nSprintf(qbuf, \\\"What do you want to name %s %s?\\\",\\n    is_plural(obj) ? \\\"these\\\" : \\\"this\\\", xname(obj));\\ngetlin(qbuf, buf);\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p><code>QBUFSZ<\\/code>, the amount of memory allocated to hold the prompt, is 128,\\nso <code>qbuf<\\/code> is allocated 128 characters.  As can be seen from the\\nscreenshot, the prompt is well over 128 characters long (I'd\\nintentionally caused this crash by giving the item a very long name).\\nHowever, the crash did not happen straight away; the most likely\\nreason is that <code>qbuf<\\/code> overflowed into <code>buf<\\/code>, which happened to be just\\nafter it on the stack, and thus the runtime system noticed nothing\\nwrong, with the actual crash caused by an overflow due to the entire\\nmessage (including my response) being more than 256 characters\\n(<code>BUFSZ<\\/code>, the most common fixed size for a string in NetHack 3.4.3);\\n<code>getlin<\\/code> assumes that its first argument is less than <code>QBUFSZ<\\/code>\\ncharacters when ensuring that it allocates enough memory for its own\\nuse.  Of course, nothing guarantees that a buffer overflow will be\\ncaught at all, but modern operating systems are getting increasingly\\ngood at catching them because they frequently lead to security\\nexploits.  It would be unwise to rely on this in practice, though.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Strings are probably the largest offender in this regard in NetHack\\n3.4.3, although there are some overflows in various other unexpected\\nplaces.  For instance, filling the largest bigroom variant entirely\\nwith boulders, then attempting to travel diagonally from one end to\\nthe other, causes a crash; this is because a fixed-size buffer on the\\nstack is used to hold the internal state of the travel logic, and\\nalthough the buffer should be large enough, a bug causes boulders to\\nbe stored 64 times in the buffer, and although only a small subset of\\nthe boulders is ever stored there at a time, a sufficiently full level\\nwill nonetheless overflow the buffer.  (Incidentally, I discovered\\nthis bug accidentally writing AceHack; in AceHack, changes to the\\ntravel logic meant that the bug could be triggered using lava instead\\nof boulders, and I got a crash trying to travel in the Valkyrie\\nquest.)<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Although this technique is a useful one, and probably used for the\\nmajority of memory storage in both NetHack 3.4.3 and NetHack 4, its\\ndrawbacks mean that we need to look for other options in the cases\\nwhere it fails.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Static allocation<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>This is arguably even simpler than stack allocation; write a variable\\noutside any function, and/or use the <code>static<\\/code> keyword, and it's\\nallocated once at the start of the program and only deallocated when\\nthe program exits.  (The <code>static<\\/code> keyword causes the variable to have\\na limited scope, despite the infinite duration of its allocation;\\nwithout the keyword, the compiler will make the variable anywhere in\\nthe program, including in different files, a so-called &quot;global&quot;\\nvariable.  Even without the keyword, though, the variable is still\\nconsidered statically allocated.)<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>There are many situations where it's tempting to do this. Here are\\nsome of the reasons why people do:<\\/p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>It's one of the easiest ways to solve visibility issues; if a\\nvariable is global, it only requires a quick <code>extern<\\/code> declaration\\nanywhere in the code to be able to read or write it.  If there's\\ntruly only one copy of the variable, this is typically simpler and\\nless error-prone than trying to pass pointers to it everywhere as\\nfunction arguments (and what is sometimes suggested as the\\n&quot;correct&quot; solution to the problem, dependency injection, is\\nbasically impossible to do in C due to its poor metaprogramming\\nabilities).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, the flip side of this is that it becomes ingrained deep\\ninto your program design that there is only one copy of that\\nvariable, and it's easy to introduce bugs by using the variable\\nwhile its value is meaningless (although it's allocated for the\\nentire program's duration, often it isn't meaningful for the\\nentire duration).  Both these problems can be alleviated to some\\nextent by using an accessor function or macro (which is part of\\nthe reason that NetHack 4 has been introducing accessors and\\nmutators for many globally visible variables).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Still, this is one of the better reasons to use a global variable.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<li><p>It's possible to return a reference to a statically allocated\\nvariable from a function.  So long as nothing overwrites the\\nvariable until its next use, this is a method of returning large\\nor complex (i.e. containing internal pointers) structures from\\nfunctions that can actually be made to work, unlike stack\\nallocations, which can never correctly be referenced.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The downside of this is that it's extraordinarily fragile.  It\\nfails completely in the presence of multithreading or if called\\nfrom signal handlers; it is very hard to get it working correctly\\nfor recursive functions; and even for regular old-fashioned\\nfunction calls with nothing special about them, statements about\\nthe lifetime of the value that's returned are very hard to make,\\nmeaning that apparently innocuous changes to the code can cause\\nmajor problems.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This is no longer considered a legitimate reason to statically\\nallocate variables in NetHack 4 (and increasingly, in other\\ncontexts, too; many standard POSIX functions have new versions\\nwith names ending in <code>_r<\\/code> that do not attempt to use it).  Some\\nstill exist because we haven't got around to getting rid of them\\nyet, or haven't yet found a suitable replacement.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<li><p>The value stored in a statically allocated variable will persist\\nuntil explicitly changed, even across function call boundaries.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This has lead to a huge number of subtle bugs in NetHack (for\\ninstance, the way in which you can use a stethoscope for free\\nmultiple times in a turn in NetHack 3.4.3 by saving in between).\\nThe problem is that these values are typically effectively part of\\nthe gamestate, yet nothing's forcing them to be reset between one\\ngame and the next (NetHack 3.4.3 exits the process between games\\nto help reduce this problem), or to be saved in the save file when\\nexiting the process mid-game.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<p>So although we have some advantages here, we also have a lot of\\nproblems.  One of the ongoing projects in NetHack 4 development at the\\nmoment is the &quot;globals purge&quot;, where we try to get rid of global and\\nstatic variables (e.g. by making them stack-allocated when possible,\\nor replacing them with constants when possible), or at least to make\\nthem better-behaved.  Here are some of the reasons we keep them\\naround, and some of the techniques we use in order to alleviate some\\nof their issues:<\\/p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>Variables that are global for visibility reasons typically have to\\nbe kept as global for that reason, but in NetHack 4, we namespace\\nthem into a few structs (<code>u<\\/code>, <code>flags<\\/code>, <code>program_state<\\/code>).  This\\nmeans that at least we have only a few places to look to ensure\\nthat they are being saved and restored correctly.  It also helps\\nto future-proof for things like multiplayer play (you can replace\\nthe structs with arrays if there ever needs to be more than one of\\nthem, and then only have to deal with communicating the array\\nindex rather than the entire contents of the struct).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>When I wrote the multiplayer patch for AceHack, global variables\\nwere one of the larger issues, given that many of them needed to\\nbe different for different players.  My solution was a little\\nextreme; I used an entire separate process for each player,\\nmeaning that each player would have their own set of global\\nvariables, and then communicated all the data that needed to be\\nshared via passing save files around between processes every\\naction.  This might seem backwards and wasteful, but it was easier\\nto track all the shared data (using the save file), than it was to\\ntrack the various random information stored in globals!  For\\nNetHack 4, I'm hoping that a multiplayer patch would not need to\\nresort to such extreme lengths.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<li><p>Some functions legitimately need to preserve their state for a\\nshort time, communicating it to other functions or to future\\ninvocations of the same function, but not to need to place it in\\nthe save file.  An example that caused us trouble for a while was\\nthe state used while praying; you start praying, and three turns\\nlater the prayer finishes.  The game needs to decide whether the\\nprayer is receptive or not when you start praying, because it\\neffects whether you are invulnerable or not, but cannot repeat the\\ncalculation at the end (e.g. because your prayer timeout might\\nhave dropped from +1 to &minus;2 during those three turns), and so needs\\nto remember the value across those three turns.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>It's impossible to save while praying in NetHack 3.4.3; in NetHack\\n4.3, it's possible to save at any time (in order to handle hangup\\ncorrectly), but this is accomplished via remembering the gamestate\\nthe last time it could safely be saved (i.e. not during prayer),\\nand the character's actions since, and replaying them upon reload\\n(or reverting if changes to the code mean they can't be replayed).\\nThus, the prayer state never needs to appear in the save file.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>In NetHack 4, we've introduced a struct <code>turnstate<\\/code> for this sort\\nof variable.  In order to use the turnstate mechanism, the code\\nmust ensure that there is no attempt to calculate the gamestate\\nportion of the save file while turnstate variables have\\nnon-default values, putting them back to their defaults once the\\nplayer regains control of their character.  The turnstate values\\nare repeatedly checked to ensure that this is the case; as a\\nresult, any values in turnstate cannot end up bypassing the\\nsave/reload system (and we get a useful debug message if some\\nbroken code attempts to do this).<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<h2>Rotating buffers<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>This is a trick that's sometimes used to work around one of the\\nproblems with static variables: returning them from functions gives\\nthem a lifetime that's hard to determine, and sometimes too short.\\nThe idea is to have an array of static variables, that are used in\\nsequence, cycling back to the first once the last is used.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The result is a variable that works almost entirely like a static\\nvariable in terms of its properties as a return value.  Its lifetime\\nis still basically impossible to determine, but longer than it would\\nbe otherwise.  The code then simply hopes it's long enough (or to put\\nit more kindly, ensures that the return value from the function is\\ncopied somewhere safe before the function is called another <em>n<\\/em>\\ntimes).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This technique is used by NetHack 3.4.3 to handle strings returned\\nfrom object naming functions (which are often built up out of other\\nstrings returned by object naming functions), mediated by the function\\n<code>nextobuf<\\/code>.  To make things even more confusing, some of the object\\nnaming functions assume that the return values from other functions\\nwere constructed like this (an assumption that is not documented\\nanywhere), and take the opportunity to alter them in-place.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>With respect to object naming functions in particular, this technique\\nhas another problem; given that the buffers are fixed size, they can\\noverflow if a sufficiently long object name is used.  I'm not sure\\nwhat the longest possible object name is, but it's got to be quite\\nclose to 256 characters.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>I haven't yet ripped this mess out of NetHack 4, but I want to.  Part\\nof the reason I'm writing this blog post is to give me a nice list of\\nstrategies I could potentially replace it with, to help me decide what\\nthe correct fix is.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Single dynamic allocation with ownership semantics<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>There is one other place where memory can be allocated in C; instead\\nof placing it on the stack, or statically allocating it, it can be\\nallocated using <code>malloc<\\/code>, which obtains a block of memory of a given\\nsize in some system-specific manner (e.g. one common mechanism is to\\nfind some free space in a single large resizable block of memory known\\nas the &quot;heap&quot;, making it larger if necessary; there are others).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The concept of single dynamic allocation is quite simple: you need a\\nvariable of a particular size, and so you just create it with a call\\nto <code>malloc<\\/code> when you need it.  This neatly gets around all the\\nproblems with the previous methods, because the memory will persist as\\nlong as you need it, and won't be overwritten except if you explicitly\\noverwrite it.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Instead, the problem with this method is getting rid of the memory\\nagain when you no longer need it.  There's a standard function <code>free<\\/code>\\nthat releases an allocation made using <code>malloc<\\/code>, but knowing when to\\ncall it can be difficult.  The most common method of doing this is\\n&quot;ownership semantics&quot;; whenever a pointer to dynamic memory gets\\npassed around, part of the API is whether the ownership of the pointer\\nis being passed (in which case the recipient is responsible for\\nfreeing it and the sender cannot keep copies), or whether the sender\\nkeeps the ownership (in which case the sender remains responsible for\\nfreeing it and the recipient cannot keep copies nor pass the ownership\\non itself).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This would seem to be a nicely simple and general method of handling\\nfixed-size memory.  However, there are a few reasons why it is not\\nused everywhere:<\\/p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>It's a bunch of typing; it's much easier to write<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>{\\n    struct obj otmp;\\n    /* do stuff with otmp */\\n}\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>than it is to write<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>{\\n    struct obj *otmp;\\n    otmp = malloc(sizeof *otmp);\\n    /* do stuff with otmp */\\n    free(otmp);\\n}\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>And of course, the latter code needed to do a stack allocation\\nanyway in order to store the address of the memory it allocated.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This is pretty minor, but in cases where stack and dynamic\\nallocations are otherwise equally good, there's no real reason to\\ndo the dynamic allocation at all; it just makes your code harder\\nto read.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<li><p>It is hard, in C, to make sure that your ownership semantics are\\nbeing tracked correctly; if you make a mistake, often apparently\\nnothing will go wrong, but your program is now incorrect (either\\nin terms of a use-after-free, a double-free, or simply just\\nleaking memory).  There are other languages that aim to solve this\\nproblem (notably Rust, although various C++ libraries go a good\\nway towards being able to solve it too), but converting NetHack's\\ncodebase to a new language would be very difficult (even one as\\nsimilar as C++, which has many potentially relevant details that\\ndiffer from C).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>There are also program analyzers that are meant to be able to\\ncatch memory allocation mistakes.  <code>splint<\\/code> is designed to do this\\nbut requires many changes to the program and turns out to be\\nunusably buggy in practice.  <code>valgrind<\\/code> works excellently, but\\nworks on a running program, and thus can only catch issues that\\nyou actually trigger in your test run; additionally, in the case\\nof a memory leak, it can determine where the allocation was, but\\nnot where the free should have been.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<li><p>However, the largest reason I've been moving away from the most\\nnaive version of dynamic allocation in NetHack 4 is exception\\nsafety.  In C++, the use of RAII means that exceptions can be made\\nto free any dynamically allocated objects whose owners went out of\\nscope as a result of the exception.  In C, we don't easily have\\nthat option available to us, and those objects are just going to\\nstay allocated.  As a result, when short-lived dynamically\\nallocated objects are used in NetHack 4, we have to ensure that\\nit's impossible to have an exception while the object is alive\\n(which means, for instance, the code cannot make any attempts to\\nget user input; a problem, because constructing prompts to show to\\nthe user is one of the situations you'd otherwise want to use\\ndynamic allocation for).<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<p>Here's an amusing example of this technique in use, new to the NetHack\\n4 codebase:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>case OPTTYPE_KEYMAP:\\n    str = malloc(1 + sizeof \\\"submenu\\\");\\n    strcpy(str, \\\"submenu\\\");\\n    return str;\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>Why not just return the string <code>&quot;submenu&quot;<\\/code>?  Because the function in\\nquestion can return strings from a range of different sources.  That\\none's a compile-time constant, but not all of them have the luxury of\\nbeing able to return compile-time constants.  For instance, another\\npossibility is for the return value to be the ASCII representation of\\na number; the code for that prints it into a fixed-size buffer on the\\nstack, then makes a dynamically allocated copy of it so as to be able\\nto return it from a function.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This case of creating text for the current values of options on the\\noption menu is a perfect scenario for ownership semantics because the\\ntext simply has to be calculated, added to the menu, and then can be\\nfreed again (a few lines later, before we've lost track of the owner\\nof the text); yet a stack allocation would be awkward due to the way\\nthe code flow in the section works.  In most cases, things aren't that\\nsimple due to the possibility of exceptions and the lifetime of the\\nobject being longer (and thus harder to track).  Thus, despite being\\nhugely widespread in most C codebases, this is relatively rarely used\\nin the NetHack 4 codebase.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Allocation on chains<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>This is a technique used in both the NetHack 3.4.3 and NetHack 4\\ncodebases in order to gain the advantages of dynamic allocation, while\\ndodging many of the disadvantages.  The basic idea is for all objects\\nof a particular sort to be stored on an &quot;allocation chain&quot; (typically\\nmost easily implemented as a linked list whose metadata is part of the\\nobjects themselves, although any method of implementing a set would\\nwork); they're placed on a chain when allocated (there can be, and\\noften is, more than one), and removed when freed.  Any of the other\\nmemory management techniques in C can be used to track the chain\\nitself (for instance, it could be a global variable, or possibly even\\nstack allocated).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>For this technique to work properly, the code needs to know points in\\ntime at which the chains should be empty (otherwise there's no real\\nbenefit to tracking them); this is the main restriction on this\\ntechnique.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>It works pretty well, though, when that restriction is not an issue:<\\/p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>It enables the code to monitor its allocations at runtime, making\\ndouble-frees and memory leaks detectable (although not\\nuse-after-frees).  While not as good as a compile-time guarantee,\\nit's nonetheless helpful in catching errors in practice.\\n(Incidentally, this check is responsible for what is probably\\nNetHack 4's record number of <code>panic<\\/code>s in a day, trying to iron out\\nbugs I'd introduced converting the item code to be fully\\nallocation-chain based.)<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<li><p>It can handle exceptions (i.e. <code>longjmp<\\/code>), just so long as after\\nthe jump, it's possible to determine, by analyzing objects on the\\nchains, whether they should be allocated or not (the ones that\\nshouldn't be get deallocated).  Typically this is via arranging\\nthings such that the chains are supposed to be empty after an\\nexception, meaning that anything that's found on the chains can be\\nfreed.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<p>NetHack 3.4.3 uses an approximation of this technique for handing\\nitems (although probably for a different reason than memory safety).\\nEach item is on one of a large number of chains; many are gamestate\\n(e.g. &quot;the chain containing the possessions of &laquo;monster&raquo;&quot;). In NetHack\\n4, there are also chains for turnstate, and for items that are\\ncurrently being moved around between locations (in case an exception\\nhappens after an object's been removed from one gamestate chain and\\nbefore it's been placed on another; the length of time during which an\\nitem is on no chain is just a few lines, which can easily be checked\\nto ensure they can't cause exceptions); getting that to correctly\\nhandle unusual situations (such as stacks being split or items being\\npolymorphed) is what caused all the panics.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This technique's used in other places in NetHack 4, too.  A good\\nexample is the menu code in the interface.  NetHack 4 avoids a hard\\nlimit on the number of menus that can be drawn on the screen at once,\\nmeaning that a static buffer is unusable, and because menus need to\\nmove on the screen when the screen is resized (which could happen with\\nany number of menus open), stack allocation would be awkward for\\nvisibility reasons.  Instead, a statically allocated menu chain is\\nused, holding currently open menus.  It is possible to need to quit\\nthe current game with menus open (currently only due to hangup, but\\nI'm planning to add a &quot;save anywhere&quot; feature before 4.3 is released),\\ncausing an exception.  However, the game can deallocate the menus\\nbecause exceptions in NetHack 4 always work by jumping back to a known\\nstate (just before the game was loaded) and replaying from there, and\\nthus it's known that no menus should be on the screen, and they can\\nall be removed.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, a cautionary tale.  NitroHack has an allocation chain for\\nobjects being communicated over the API from the server to the client.\\nIt's freed every turn.  This loses most of the benefits of allocation\\nchains, and makes it very difficult for the client to work out the\\nlifetimes of the objects it receives (especially as there's no\\nguarantee that there's even a game running, so the concept of &quot;turn&quot;\\nmay be meaningless).  In NetHack 4, I changed it to be freed with\\nevery API call, which effectively works the same way as returning a\\nstatic buffer from the client's point of view.  This is better, but\\nstill unsatisfactory, really; perhaps I'll find a better option\\nsomeday.  The moral of the story is that allocation chains do not\\nmagically solve all the issues with dynamic allocation; sometimes\\nthey're appropriate, but sometimes you need to find something else.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Reference counting<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>No discussion of memory management in C would be complete without a\\nmention of one of the most general methods for dealing with it.\\nInstead of having one owner for an object, as in ownership semantics,\\nyou allow any number of owners for each object, and keep a count on\\nthe object of how many owners it has.  When an owner no longer cares\\nabout an object, it decreases the count, and deallocates it if the\\ncount became 0.  This is basically just a generalization of ownership\\nsemantics; it does nothing to help with exceptions, because you cannot\\nknow whether the reference count is correct or not after an exception.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>There are some sorts of programs where reference counting is very\\nuseful; in particular, the sorts of programs most suited to functional\\nprogramming (such as parsers, compilers, and other programs that mess\\nwith abstract syntax trees) often are best implemented using immutable\\nobjects that each hvae multiple owners, rather than giving each owner\\ntheir own mutable copy.  NetHack is, however, not really that sort of\\nprogram, and there are few situations in which the power of reference\\ncounting is needed.  (Arguably, it would even hurt; the most famous\\nsituation in which reference counting breaks down is reference cycles,\\nand there are quite a few of those in the item handling code, albeit\\nwith clear rules for breaking cycles using weak references.)<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>There is one case where reference counting is used in NetHack 4; the\\n(external) JSON parser library supports reference counting for JSON\\nobjects, and thus NetHack 4 is forced to interface with that.  As far\\nas I know, though, it isn't used for anything other than emulating\\na single-owner semantics but with more boilerplate.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Caller allocates<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>As mentioned earlier, one of the big problems with stack allocations\\nis that they're not particularly useful for returning values from\\nfunctions, and using static buffers for the purpose is a bad idea.\\nSometimes you can avoid the problems using dynamic allocation (&quot;callee\\nallocates&quot;); but as seen above, that has its own issues.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>One widespread solution to this problem is to have the caller do the\\nallocation itself, then tell the function it's calling where it wants\\nthe return value to be placed.  The callee thus has the memory it\\nneeds to write in already, and doesn't need to worry about its\\nlifetime; that's the caller's job.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>So long as the caller knows how large the memory it needs to allocate\\nis at compile time, there are very few downsides to doing things this\\nway.  Any sort of allocation the callee could do, the caller can do\\ntoo, and the caller has a better idea of what lifetime the data needs\\nthan the callee does.  Additionally, there are two things that the\\ncaller can do that the callee couldn't; it can allocate objects on the\\nstack using its own lifetime (which is very useful if it's planning to\\nuse them itself rather than return them to some other function); and\\nit can use storage that was allocated by <em>its<\\/em> caller, and so on ad\\ninfinitum.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The problem, of course, is that the caller absolutely needs to know\\nthe size of the object that's going to be returned to it, or it has no\\nway to allocate an object large enough (other than guessing, which is\\nprone to failure).  For objects that inherently tend to have a\\nvariable length, such as strings, this doesn't work so well.  The most\\ninfamous example is <code>gets<\\/code>, which was once a standard C function; its\\npurpose is to return a string from standard input, with no length\\nlimit.  Given that the only way for <code>gets<\\/code>'s caller to be completely\\nsure of how much memory to allocate would be if it had placed the\\nstring on standard input itself, defeating the whole point of the\\nsystem call, it quickly became apparent that all useful uses of <code>gets<\\/code>\\nwere security vulnerabilities, and the function was subsequently\\nremoved from the standard.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>It is perhaps unfortunate, then, that NetHack 3.4.3 uses\\ncaller-allocates mostly for strings, one of the least suited sorts of\\ndata for the technique.  There's a convention that the amount of space\\nto allocate is <code>BUFSZ<\\/code> (256), and callees are therefore supposed to\\ncheck this to make sure that they don't overflow the caller's buffer,\\nbut the code usually seems to forget the check in practice.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Examples of better uses include coordinate handling code, such as\\n<code>dtoxy<\\/code> in NetHack 3.4.3 (that asks the caller to allocate a pair of\\ncoordinates), and <code>arg_from_delta<\\/code> in NetHack 4 (which fills in an\\n<code>nh_cmd_arg<\\/code> structure provided by the caller; the function's purpose\\nis to convert a direction given as x/y/z coordinates into a structure\\nused to remember the context of a user's command so that it can be\\nrepeated correctly with control-A).<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So far, we've been looking at techniques that only work when the size\\nof the object we're trying to allocate is known at compile time.\\nThose are, unfortunately, the easy ones, despite there being such a\\nrange of possibilities to handle it.  If it isn't known how large the\\nobject will be, things can get a lot worse.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Variable length arrays<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>Variable length VLAs are a feature added to C in C99, and thus often\\nconsidered a &quot;new&quot; feature even though C99 was released approximately\\n15 years ago.  (Something similar to VLAs, yet which works on many\\nolder compilers, is <code>alloca<\\/code>, which is not defined in the C standards\\nbut is nonetheless a commonly provided extension.  It doesn't mix well\\nwith VLAs, though.)  The idea is pretty simple: if a C implementation\\nuses a stack for handling automatic variables, then it can allocate a\\nvariable amount of memory as easily as a fixed amount of memory, so\\nwhy shouldn't that capability be available to user programs?<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The big advantage of VLAs is that you get all the advantages of stack\\nallocations, except now you don't need to know how large your object\\nis at compile time, so long as you know how large it is some time\\nbefore you need to allocate it.  VLAs are used heavily in code newly\\nwritten for NetHack 4, as a result; in particular, the exception\\nsafety of stack allocations is something that is often much more\\nawkward to gain any other way.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>In fact, pretty much our only answer to &quot;why aren't you just using a\\nVLA&quot; is &quot;we can't&quot;:<\\/p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>Although not as odious a requirement as knowing the size of the\\nallocation at compile time, it's often still impossibe to know the\\nsize of the object even at the time you try to allocate it.  For\\ninstance, not even VLAs will make <code>gets<\\/code> work.  Many of the\\nfollowing sections will be discussing various workarounds to this.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<li><p>VLAs are still stack allocations, and so they still can't have a\\nlifetime larger than the function that allocates them.  So they're\\nstill useless for returning values from functions.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<p>These problems both come up surprisingly often in practice.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Buffer bumping<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>Just as VLAs are the variable-length version of stack allocations,\\n&quot;buffer bumping&quot; is my name for the variable-length version of static\\nallocations.  (I'm not sure if there's an official or widely-used\\none.)  This is seen quite widely in NitroHack code; I'm not aware of\\nit being used in NetHack 3.4.3.  I've mostly got rid of it for NetHack\\n4, usually via finding a way to avoid static allocations entirely,\\nalthough it is nonetheless appropriate in some cases (such as the\\n&quot;Things that are here:&quot; display in the interface, which needs to be\\nglobal for visibility reasons; being part of the interface, there's no\\nneed to worry about ensuring that it ends up in the save file).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The basic idea is to have a statically allocated pointer, initially\\n<code>NULL<\\/code>.  Whenever you want to write to the static storage in question,\\nyou check to ensure it's allocated and large enough.  If it isn't, you\\nreallocate it larger (<code>free<\\/code> followed by <code>malloc<\\/code> is the most\\nefficient way to do this if you don't care about its old contents;\\n<code>realloc<\\/code> copies the contents over from the old location to the new\\nlarger location, and thus is useful if the old contents are still\\nrelevant).  Thus, the buffer never actually gets smaller, and ends up\\nstill allocated at the end of the program, at which point it's\\ndeallocated by the operating system.  A variation is to resize the\\nmemory smaller at any point where less of it is needed, or perhaps\\ndeallocate it altogether (setting the variable back to <code>NULL<\\/code>) once\\nit's no longer relevant; this is probably marginally slower and\\nprobably marginally less wasteful of memory, but the size of both\\nchanges tends to be so small that it's very unlikely it would make a\\ndifference in practice.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>One nice advantage of this method is that you don't need to know the\\nsize of the object you're storing in advance; you can bump the buffer\\nhalfway through filling it if you have to.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>There are some problems with doing things this way:<\\/p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>In addition to the standard advantages of static allocation, you\\nhave all the standard drawbacks of static allocation, too.  You\\ncan have a better idea of when the value is meaningful (perhaps\\nmaking errors in resetting it easier to detect), but that's about\\nit; you still have the uncertainty about lifetimes, and the issues\\nwith ensuring that the variable is saved correctly.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>These disadvantages can be mitigated the same way as they can be\\nmitigated with regular statically allocated variables.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<li><p>There's also a new problem, though.  With statically allocated\\nvariables, if you pass pointers to them around, those pointers\\nwill at least remain valid forever.  Buffer bumping, because it\\nresizes memory, can sometimes end up giving it a new address; I\\nhope nobody was saving a pointer to it!  Worse, the new address is\\nusually but not always the same as the old one, making this\\ndifficult to debug, because simple tests will normally not notice\\na problem, and tests that do observe a problem may fail to\\nreproduce it.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This can be worked around using an extra layer of indirection,\\npassing around a pointer to the statically allocated pointer\\nitself rather than to the memory it points to, but the code gets\\nincreasingly hard to read and maintain as a result.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<p>You could theoretically do this for rotating buffers, too.  That might\\narguably be an improvement on the current object naming code, but the\\nresult would be both hideous and massively fragile.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Dynamic reallocation<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>This is the standard method for dealing with data of an unknown size.\\nYou start off with just a small dynamic allocation (or sometimes even\\nan effective 0-byte allocation using a null pointer); and keep track\\nof how much memory is allocated, in addition to tracking a pointer to\\nthe memory itself.  Then you start doing whatever calculations you\\nneed to do in order to construct the object itself.  If you ever find\\nthere isn't enough memory, you just make it larger, using <code>realloc<\\/code> to\\ncopy the old contents over.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>For performance reasons, it helps to resize the object in large steps\\nrather than small steps; reallocating it one byte larger every time\\nround a loop can lead to quadratic performance.  When the expected\\nsizes are large, reallocations typically multiply the allocated size\\nby a factor (often 2 or 1.5), in order to ensure that the performance\\nremains linear no matter what.  When the expected sizes are small, you\\ncan simply round up to a multiple of some number that's larger than\\ncommonly expected sizes, and have efficiency in the common case and\\ncode that continues to work even in the rare cases where you're\\ndealing with more data than expected.  Here's an example from the\\nNetHack 4 codebase (this is part of a <code>strcat<\\/code> implementation for\\ndynamically reallocated memory, quite similar to <code>StringBuilder<\\/code> in\\nJava):<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>if (strlen_first + strlen_second &gt;= *first_alloclen) {\\n    int first_was_null = !*first;\\n\\n    *first_alloclen = ((strlen_first + strlen_second + 1) / 256) * 256 + 256;\\n    *first = realloc(*first, *first_alloclen);\\n\\n    if (first_was_null)\\n        **first = 0;\\n}\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>The code has to handle both <code>first_alloclen<\\/code> and <code>first<\\/code> itself; it\\nalso needs to maintain a NUL terminator on <code>first<\\/code>, because <code>strcat<\\/code>\\nworks on NUL-terminated strings.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The advantages of this technique:<\\/p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>If dynamic allocation is appropriate for whatever you're doing (in\\nNetHack 4, that normally means code that's entirely about\\ncalculation and doesn't cross the client/server boundary or do\\ncommunication with the user), then all you have to do is add an\\nextra variable to store the allocation length (stored the same way\\nas your pointer), and your reallocations will work fine.  This is\\nespecially useful if you would be using dynamic allocation anyway,\\nbut stack allocations are not hard to convert if their\\nexception-related properties aren't needed.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<li><p>It works quite neatly with caller-allocates; so long as you can\\nrequire the caller to do a dynamic allocation, and add an extra\\nlevel of indirection to the call, you can have the callee do the\\nreallocation.  (This is what's going on with the <code>*first<\\/code> and\\n<code>*first_alloclen<\\/code> in the code sample above.)  That said, if the\\ncallee can do reallocation, there often isn't much need to make\\nthe caller do the original allocation; the main benefit is if you\\nneed mutiple callees to do reallocations on the same buffer.<\\/p><\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<p>The disadvantage, of course, is that you're doing a dynamic\\nallocation.  Even when you can use ownership semantics (which is\\n&quot;usually but not always&quot;), it's not always possible to guarantee that\\nyour allocation won't end up leaking due to an exception.  As such,\\nthis technique is not that widely used in NetHack 4, although it does\\nshow up occasionally.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Count and copy<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>Using a caller-allocates system has several advantages, but one big\\ndisadvantage: the caller has to know the size of allocation to\\nperform.  However, there is one way in which it can frequently find\\nout: ask the function which is eventually going to fill the buffer it\\nallocates.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The basic idea of count-and-copy is to provide functions with an\\nargument that specifies whether to count the size of their output, or\\nto copy their output into a provided buffer (conveniently, the\\nargument can be the buffer itself, setting it to <code>NULL<\\/code> to represent a\\ncount).  This works particularly well when an entire call hierarchy\\nuses it, because the callee can go and ask the functions <em>it<\\/em> calls\\nhow much data they plan to return, and use it to determine how much\\ndata it will return, without needing to actually generate the data\\nitself.  In the most appropriate situations for count-and-copy, the\\ncount can be very fast, and thus not cause much of an efficiency loss\\n(or in extreme circumstances even an efficiency gain) compared to\\ndynamic reallocation; and it can achieve this with all the advantages\\nof caller-allocates at the same time!  (Most likely, the caller will\\nuse a VLA to do the allocation, although it could allocate dynamically\\nif it want to, or even use buffer-bumping.)<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Count-and-copy is not so good if the callee needs to effectively\\ncalculate the object it's going to return just to be able to determine\\nhow large it is, and it's horrific if the callee needs to allocate\\nmemory to be able to calculate that.  As such, it isn't a technique\\nthat's appropriate in all situations.  It also suffers from longer\\ncode than some other techniques, and potentially repetitive code too\\n(you have to call a function twice to use it, and the two calls cannot\\nbe wrapped in a function because that would mess up the scope of the\\nobject being allocated).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This technique turns up in an unusual place in NetHack 3.4.3: the game\\nsave code.  This is particularly unexpected because unlike in NetHack\\n4, the save code in 3.4.3 does not have a return value apart from &quot;the\\nsave worked, exit the game&quot; or &quot;the save failed, keep playing&quot;; the\\nsave file itself is written to disk.  However, NetHack is even older\\nthan C99 (in fact, even older than C89), and dates from an era when\\nhard disks might not be installed and floppy disks were pretty small;\\nthere was a real risk that the save file would fail to fit on the\\nremaining space on the drive, and thus counting the amount of\\navailable space before copying onto the disk ensured that the save\\nwould not fail halfway through (perhaps corrupting the gamestate in\\nthe process, because the save code is also responsible for memory\\ndeallocation in that version).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>A more typical example is the <code>vsnprintf<\\/code> function from the C\\nstandards (which libuncursed, a rendering library I wrote for NetHack\\n4, uses to interpret its equivalent of a <code>printf<\\/code> statement).  There's\\na <code>vsprintf<\\/code> function that uses a caller-allocates system, but\\nalthough the caller sometimes knows the maximum length that can be\\nproduced from a given format string, libuncursed would have to\\nreproduce much of the logic of <code>printf<\\/code> to be able to work it out for\\nan arbitrary format string provided by its users.  <code>vsnprintf<\\/code> uses a\\ncount-and-copy interface instead, allowing libuncursed to determine\\nhow large a buffer it needs to provide for the next call to\\n<code>vsnprintf<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Sadly, it turns out that the version of <code>vsnprintf<\\/code> available in the C\\ntoolchain for Windows that I'm using is buggy; it returns an error\\ncode, rather than the buffer size, if the buffer is absent or too\\nsmall, which is behaviour forbidden by the standard.  Thus, in\\nlibuncursed, I had to write a loop that detects this situation and\\ntries successively larger buffers until the correct buffer size is\\ndetermined.  I guess that's better than <code>gets<\\/code>, at least&hellip;<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Callee-cleans<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>Sometimes, you have no option but to use dynamic reallocation for\\nobtaining the memory for your object.  For instance, NetHack creates a\\nlot of menus, often with a range of different functions responsible\\nfor adding various items to the menu; and although count-and-copy is\\ntheoretically usable for that, the code would become something of a\\nmess, especially as counting menu items is often quite inefficient.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>However, menus cannot be dynamically allocated either; the lack of\\nexception-safety is a problem, because &quot;showing a menu to the user&quot; is\\na particularly likely situation to get an exception.  Not only is it\\nboth possible, and reasonable in practice, to get a hangup there, but\\nif the menu needs to be closed asynchronously without user\\ninteraction, NetHack 4 implements that with exceptions too (for\\ninstance, this can happen if you're watching someone else's game and\\nthey close a menu).<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Although the situation seems unsolvable (or worse, solvable using\\nglobal variables), there is a solution, albeit a reasonably absurd\\none.  Here's the relevant part of NetHack 4's menu code:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>/* Make a stack-allocated copy of the menulist, in case we end up longjmping\\n   out of here before we get a chance to deallocate it. */\\nstruct nh_menuitem item_copy[ml-&gt;icount ? ml-&gt;icount : 1];\\nif (ml-&gt;icount)\\n    memcpy(item_copy, ml-&gt;items, sizeof item_copy);\\n\\n/* ... some other initialization goes here ... */\\n\\ndealloc_menulist(ml);\\n\\n/* ... main body of the function goes here ... */\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>The idea is reasonably simple.  From the caller's point of view, the\\nAPI is simply &quot;you pass a dynamically allocated object, and transfer\\nownership to the callee&quot;.  The callee responds by copying the object\\ninto a VLA, and then freeing the original (which it can do, because it\\nhas ownership); thus, by the time the code reaches the point at which\\nexceptions can happen, the dynamically allocated memory is long gone.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>One potential alternative is to make the caller do the copying into a\\nVLA.  That is slightly more general, in that it allows the caller to\\nhave access to the object after the call is over (in the typical case\\nwhen there was no exception).  However, it's much worse in terms of\\ncode duplication, because a VLA is needed at every callsite rather\\nthan merely in the function being called.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Despite performing its job well, I avoid this approach in NetHack 4\\nunless the alternatives are even worse; copying an object purely for\\nthe purpose of moving it from the heap to the stack is wasteful in the\\nvast majority of cases.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As can be seen above, memory allocation in C is something of a mess,\\nand there is no simple and general solution that works for everything.\\n(This is, incidentally, one of the reasons why C is famous for being\\nmore efficient than other languages; in other languages, it's the\\ncompiler managing the memory, not you, and being a computer and thus\\nuncreative it will inevitably attempt to use the same solution for\\neverything, or at least choose from a relatively small set.)<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Sometimes it's simplest to dodge the problem.  Obviously, doing that\\nis not always possible.  In this section, we consider some methods\\nthat can be used the rest of the time.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Using indexes into lookup tables<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>Sometimes, you need to pass an argument to a function, or return a\\nvalue from a function, but there are only a finite number of possible\\nvalues.  If the number is both finite and small, then it can make a\\nlot of sense to have an explicit list, and simply pass an index into\\nthat list.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This is most commonly done with strings.  If you don't have to\\nallocate the memory for a string, its variable-length nature is not a\\nproblem.  Instead of returning memory which is allocated for the\\npurpose of holding a string, you can just return a pointer to the\\ntring in the program's data section itself; the pointer is effectively\\nan index into your program's memory image.  Of course, this only works\\nwhen all the possible return values are known in advance, or (if\\nyou're prepared to handle the lifetime headaches) static buffers.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>A good example of this in the NetHack codebase is the <code>hcolor<\\/code>\\nfunction, whose purpose is to return a nonexistent color to\\nhallucinating players, and a default color to players who are not\\nsuffering from hallucination.  Thus, a black object would be described\\nas <code>hcolor(&quot;black&quot;)<\\/code>; normally this would just be <code>&quot;black&quot;<\\/code>, but when\\nhallucinating, it might be <code>&quot;bluish-orange&quot;<\\/code> or <code>&quot;sky blue-pink&quot;<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The function's general behaviour might require a static buffer or\\ndynamic allocation if it did something more complex, but because the\\nlist of nonexistent colors is hard-coded, and the default color is\\nalso hard-coded by each caller, there's no need for messing about with\\nmemory allocation at all; the caller can just provide a constant\\nstring as the argument, and get one in return.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This technique can also be used with things other than strings;\\nmonster descriptions are one common example (in fact, the game\\nnormally works out which species a monster belongs to by converting\\nthe pointer to its monster description back into an index, relying on\\nthe fact that it's just a pointer into an array rather than allocated\\nmemory and that C is one of the very few languages that allows pointer\\narithmetic).<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Continuation passing style<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>As can be seen above, the most difficult case for handling memory\\nallocations is in function return values; stack allocations are the\\nbest general-purpose allocations, but have lifetime issues that\\nprevent them being returned from functions.  However, frequently the\\nonly thing the caller does with the return value from a function is to\\npass it to another function.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This suggests an alternative style of return value passing; instead of\\nthe callee trying to pass the return value back to the caller, the\\ncaller can instead tell the callee what it wants to do next with the\\nreturn value.  This is known as continuation passing style, or CPS.\\nHere's a hypothetical example:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>/* Without CPS */\\nchar foo[7] = \\\"foo\\\";\\nstrcat(foo, \\\"bar\\\");\\nputs(foo);\\n\\n/* With CPS */\\ncps_strcat(\\\"foo\\\", \\\"bar\\\", puts);\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>In the first version of the code, the caller needed to allocate a\\nbuffer to hold the concatenation of <code>&quot;foo&quot;<\\/code> and <code>&quot;bar&quot;<\\/code>, so that it\\ncould pass it to <code>puts<\\/code>; and it would be very easy to get the size of\\nthe buffer wrong.  The CPS version is much simpler; the <code>&quot;foobar&quot;<\\/code>\\nneeds to be allocated somewhere, but it's most likely going to be a\\nstack allocation or dynamic reallocation somewhere inside\\n<code>cps_strcat<\\/code>, which at least has the benefit of being able to look at\\nits own internals to measure the size of the resulting string.  Then\\nonce it's produced the string, it passes it on to <code>puts<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>It should be noted that the allocations could be avoided altogether if\\nsome other representation were used for the strings.  C typically uses\\na sequence of characters contiguous in memory.  If instead, for\\ninstance, a string were represented by a loop that calls an arbitrary\\n(passed-in) function once for each character in the string, no\\nvariable-length allocations would be needed in the above example.\\nThat representation is very alien to C programmers, though, and has\\neffectively no library support; additionally, although it works well\\nfor <code>strcat<\\/code>, it can struggle doing more complex string optimizations.\\n(Incidentally, I first saw it in an embedded system with less than a\\nkilobyte of memory, and no ability to dereference pointers to ROM.\\nStoring strings in RAM would have been wasteful, so it used that\\nstring representation in order to fit the string into ROM while\\nsimultaneously allowing arbitrary operations to be performed on the\\nstring.)<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The CPS technique is very widely used in implementing functional\\nlanguages, but it falls down somewhat in C.  The main issue is the\\nlack of closures, meaning that an annoying number of extra levels of\\nindirection need to be used in order to be able to pass extra\\narguments to the function that is given the return value.  (Although\\ngcc supports stack-allocated closures as an extension, this is not\\nportable to C compilers in general.)  The most promising solution to\\nthis is to come up with a kind of domain-specific language for\\ndescribing what to do with function return values (much the same way\\nas <code>printf<\\/code> has a domain-specific language for its format strings).\\nAs such, the technique seems most useful when it is only used across a\\nsmall group of callees, which all co-operate.  (Can you tell I'm\\nstrongly considering trying to use this approach for constructing\\nmessages to be shown to the user in NetHack 4?  Whether I do or not\\nwill likely depend on how readable the resulting code is and how much\\neffort converting the existing code will take.)<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>CPS is also useless at storing values long-term. You might be able to\\nconstruct a string to show as a message that way, but it's never going\\nto work as a method of storing strings in a save file.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>One other thing to note is that unlike in functional language\\nimplementations, in C, you do not want to use continuation passing\\nstyle everywhere; especially if a function has a simple return value\\n(such as an integer), you want it to return normally.  The reason is\\nthat a continuation passing style &quot;return&quot; is not a return from C's\\npoint of view, and thus does not free stack allocations.  This is fine\\nand desirable for what you use CPS for, but if there are no normal\\nreturns involved, nothing on the stack will ever be deallocated, and\\nyour program is effectively just one giant memory leak.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2>Call-by-name evaluation<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>CPS is useful for avoiding the need to allocate memory in a way that\\ncan be returned from a function, at the cost of forcing the memory to\\nbe made suitable for use as an argument instead.  The noticeable\\nfeature here is that the return value is replaced with a callback.\\nThe same technique can be applied to the arguments; instead of\\nallocating memory to serve as a function argument, you instead supply\\na callback that can be used to obtain the argument.  This is known as\\nthe &quot;call by name&quot; convention; some programming languages (e.g. Algol\\n60) actually use it by default (the compiler constructs the callbacks\\ntransparently without needing user interaction), but it can be\\nemulated in &quot;call by value&quot; languages like C.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The main disadvantage of call-by-name is that it is often inefficient\\nin practice, and can be hard to reason about.  However, it has a\\ncouple of advantages for practical use: it is up to the callee whether\\nthe argument is ever evaluated at all (meaning that dead code can be\\neliminated dynamically at runtime), and more importantly, there is\\nnever a need to store the value of an argument anywhere.  (My day job\\nis actually involved with call-by-name compiler design; it has\\nadditional advantages when reasoning about programs, because control\\nstructures like <code>if<\\/code> and <code>while<\\/code> cannot be expressed as call-by-value\\nfunctions but can be expressed as call-by-name functions, meaning that\\nfewer special cases are needed to be able to reason about arbitrary\\nprograms.)<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>For the purposes of this blog post, what we're really interested in is\\nthe way in which the use of call-by-name gets around the need for\\ntemporaries to store data.  Here's some code from the current NetHack\\n4 codebase, that prints a message when an object breaks, reminding the\\nplayer that they can name it even after it's broken (unlike NetHack\\n3.4.3, which prompts for a name immediately because the player will\\nnot have a chance to name it later):<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>char buf[BUFSZ];\\n\\n/* ... */\\n\\nelse \\n    sprintf(buf, \\\"(You can name %s from the item naming menu.)\\\",\\n            an(xname(&amp;otemp)));\\npline(\\\"%s\\\", buf);\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>The current version of this code uses a bunch of fixed-size\\ntemporaries; we have <code>buf<\\/code> declared to hold the output of <code>sprintf<\\/code>,\\nbut <code>an<\\/code> and <code>xname<\\/code> also need temporaries for their return value\\n(they use a shared rotating buffer, at current).  Thus there's a lot\\nof data storage required.  (This code is a little inefficient even\\ngiven its memory allocation style: it could be simplified by simply\\nreplacing the <code>sprintf<\\/code> calls with <code>pline<\\/code> calls, avoiding the need\\nfor <code>buf<\\/code>, but still requiring storage from <code>an<\\/code> and <code>xname<\\/code>. That\\nwould avoid the need for the doubled-up formatted prints.)<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Imagine what this code would look like in call-by-name:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>struct cbn_string *buf;\\n\\n/* ... */\\n\\nelse \\n    buf = strcat3(\\\"(You can name \\\", an(xname(&amp;otemp)),\\n                  \\\"from the item naming menu.)\\\");\\npline(buf);\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>The code is pretty similar from the point of view of the caller, which\\nis a huge advantage, but would work very differently from the point of\\nview of actual control flow. The <code>buf =<\\/code> line isn't doing any\\ncalculations immediately; instead, it's building up a data structure.\\nIn this case, <code>strcat3<\\/code>, <code>an<\\/code>, and <code>xname<\\/code> would be macros that\\ncreate a structure that describes the string to evaluate, probably\\nexpanding to something like the following C99 code:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>buf = &amp;(struct cbn_strcat3){\\n    CBN_STRCAT, &amp;(struct cbn_literal){CBN_LITERAL, \\\"(You can name \\\"},\\n    &amp;(struct cbn_an){CBN_AN, &amp;(struct cbn_xname){CBN_XNAME, &amp;otemp}},\\n    &amp;(struct cbn_literal){CBN_LITERAL, \\\"%s from the item naming menu.)\\\"}};\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>We now have a data structure that describes which object naming\\nfunctions need to be called, with hardly any change in the original\\ncode (our only change was to replace <code>sprintf<\\/code>, which takes a variable\\nnumber of arguments and thus is very difficult to handle via macros,\\nwith a hypothetical <code>strcat3<\\/code> that concatenates exactly three\\nstrings).  Then, &quot;all&quot; <code>pline<\\/code> has to do is to evaluate this structure\\ninto an actual string so as to be able to show it to the user.  (We\\nuse a data structure as the callback, rather than a C function,\\nbecause C is bad at creating closures.)  Thus, this technique does not\\nget rid of the problems with passing data around entirely; the\\nimplementations of <code>an<\\/code> and <code>xname<\\/code> will still need to handle the\\nstrings somehow.  It does, however, localize the problem of memory\\nhandling to within the object naming functions, removing the need to\\nmanage memory manually from all the places that call them.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>There are some drawbacks to this approach, though.  One is efficiency;\\ncall-by-name is noticeably slower than call-by-value on every\\nbenchmark I've tried (especially because copying a name means you end\\nup evaluating it twice, as opposed to copying a value that has already\\nbeen evaluated).  Another is that the sugar given above requires some\\npretty modern compilers to work properly; although the result of\\nexpanding the macros works in C99, and thus <em>should<\\/em> be supported by\\nany compiler less than ten years old or so (although surprisingly many\\ncompilers don't care about C99 support), actually writing the macros\\nthemselves needs C11 support so that they can distinguish a pointer\\nfrom a string literal.  C11 is less than three years old right now,\\nand support for <code>_Generic<\\/code>, the required feature, just isn't there in\\npractice; the version of gcc in my distribution's repositories does\\nnot recognise the keyword at all, and clang compiles it correctly, but\\nproduces incorrect warning messages, making development awkward.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The other thing to note is that the sugar given above constructs the\\nnames themselves on the stack; they have a fixed size known at compile\\ntime, so that isn't an issue, but attempting to return them from a\\nfunction will fail.  As a result, any function that would return a\\nname has to be converted to call-by-name itself, and so the style\\nrather tends to infect its callers, meaning that it can be a major\\nchange to a program.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, just like CPS, this method tends not to work for storing data\\nin a save file.  Unlike with CPS, it's entirely possible to work out a\\nmethod to save a name; the problem is that if the data needs saving at\\nall, the name is not enough information to reproduce it.  Something\\nlike <code>getlin<\\/code>, which prompts for a string from the user, is very\\nunsuitable for call-by-name, because there would be a new prompt for a\\nstring every time it were needed, rather than remembering the string\\nthat the user gave last time.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Neither CPS nor call-by-name are used in NetHack 4 (although the\\nrendering library does something vaguely similar to call-by-name in\\norder to remove code that's unnecessary on the terminal in use, such\\nas converting characters to UTF-8 on a non-Unicode terminal).\\nAlthough I'm considering using them in places that particularly\\nbenefit, this work is still highly experimental right now, and\\nunlikely to appear in 4.3.<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n<\\/div>\",\"date\":\"Sun, 3 Nov 2013 07:00:00 GMT\",\"type\":\"article\",\"url\":\"http://nethack4.org/blog/memory.html\"}",

METRICS will support efforts to tackle this extraordinary inefficiency, and will itself update research about the extent to which randomised-controlled trials acknowledge the existence of previous investigations of the same subject. If the situation has not improved, METRICS and its collaborators will try to design new publishing practices that discourage bad behaviour among scientists.<\\/p>\\n<p>There is also Dr Ioannidis&rsquo;s pet offender: publication bias. Not all studies that are conducted get published, and the ones which do tend to be those that have significant results. That leaves a skewed impression of the evidence.<\\/p>\\n<p>Researchers have been studying publication bias for years, using various statistical tests. Again, though, there has been little reflection on these methods and their comparative effectiveness. They may, according to Dr Ioannidis, be giving both false negatives and false positives about whether or not publication bias exists in a particular body of studies.<\\/p>\\n<p>Dr Ioannidis plans to run tests on the methods of meta-research itself, to make sure he and his colleagues do not fall foul of the very criticisms they make of others. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want&rdquo;, he says, &ldquo;to take for granted any type of meta-research is ideal and efficient and nice. I don&rsquo;t want to promise that we can change the world, although this is probably what everybody has to promise to get funded nowadays.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n  <\\/div>\\n\\n      \\n  <\\/article> \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              <\\/div>\",\"date\":\"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT\",\"type\":\"article\",\"url\":\"http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21598944-sloppy-researchers-beware-new-institute-has-you-its-sights-metaphysicians\"}",

 "{\"icon\":\"http://blog.euwyn.com/favicon.ico\",\"text\":\"There\\u2019s nothing I dread more these days than having to make a customer service call. Just overhearing a friend on a 53-minute service call to Air Canada for tracking down a seemingly \\u201clost\\u201d booking was painful enough to prompt me to pen this post. In today\\u2019s Whatsapp-dominated world, why are we still stuck with long hold times with elevator music? Is there anything more annoying than having to read and correct names, addresses and credit card numbers over the phone?\\nI find it curious why email hasn\\u2019t become the favored medium for customer support. One thought is that the long-form nature of email makes it less than ideal for resolving user issues. It\\u2019d be great if users always wrote in with a succinct description of the issue they\\u2019re looking to resolve, along with all relevant supporting information. However, the process of resolving a customer issue often requires a back-and-forth conversation between the agent and the user to narrow the issues, identify possible solutions, and obtain the requisite information to provide a resolution. Email isn't great for conversations, as threads become unwieldy after about a dozen or so replies.\\nMessaging, whether by SMS or through an app, seems to be a great medium for customer support and getting resolution to edge-case issues that can't be handled by automated systems. Transmitting data like names, addresses, account and booking numbers and credit card data is much, much easier. (You\\u2019ll truly understand my pain when you note that I have a \\u201cu\\u201d and a \\u201cdouble-u\\u201d consecutively my first name.) You can also easily attach photos and screenshots of supporting documentation.\\nThere\\u2019s also a certain user expectation of \\u201csynchronous, but-not-really\\u201d associated with text-messaging. It allows either party to do further reserach or collect information without tying up the other, while also allowing for rapid-fire communication when necessary. There\\u2019s also an expectation of brevity that makes messaging a better medium than email. By design of the medium, users cannot fit essays into a message \\u2014 they are forced to present their issues one at a time, in short snippets.\\nThe primary benefit to companies would, of course, be happier users.

Just overhearing a friend on a 53-minute service call to Air Canada for tracking down a seemingly &ldquo;lost&rdquo; booking was painful enough to prompt me to pen this post. In today&rsquo;s Whatsapp-dominated world, why are we still stuck with long hold times with elevator music? &nbsp;Is there anything more annoying than having to read and correct names, addresses and credit card numbers over the phone?<br><\\/p><p>I find it curious why email hasn&rsquo;t become the favored medium for customer support. One thought is that the long-form nature of email makes it less than ideal for resolving user issues. It&rsquo;d be great if users always wrote in with a succinct description of the issue they&rsquo;re looking to resolve, along with all relevant supporting information. However, the process of resolving a customer issue often requires a back-and-forth conversation between the agent and the user to narrow the issues, identify possible solutions, and obtain the requisite information to provide a resolution. Email isn't great for conversations, as threads become unwieldy after about a dozen or so replies.<\\/p><p>Messaging, whether by SMS or through an app, seems to be a great medium for customer support and getting resolution to edge-case issues that can't be handled by automated systems. Transmitting data like names, addresses, account and booking numbers and credit card data is much, much easier. (You&rsquo;ll truly understand my pain when you note that I have a &ldquo;u&rdquo; and a &ldquo;double-u&rdquo; consecutively my first name.) You can also easily attach photos and screenshots of supporting documentation.&nbsp;<\\/p><p>There&rsquo;s also a certain user expectation of &ldquo;synchronous, but-not-really&rdquo; associated with text-messaging. It allows either party to do further reserach or collect information without tying up the other, while also allowing for rapid-fire communication when necessary. There&rsquo;s also an expectation of brevity that makes messaging a better medium than email. By design of the medium, users cannot fit essays into a message\\u200a&mdash;\\u200athey are forced to present their issues one at a time, in short snippets.<\\/p><p>The primary benefit to companies would, of course, be happier users. It&rsquo;s also quite possible that their staff members will be able to process issues much quicker, although one might argue that their current approach reduces queue length merely through user-attrition. (But certainly, that can&rsquo;t be a valid strategy?)&nbsp;Having conversations on-record helps companies audit and train agents much better, as well as quickly gain customer insight.<\\/p><p>So why haven&rsquo;t companies all flocked to this medium?

If the registrant doesn't do this within 15 days then the registrarmust suspend the domain name.\\nWe've seen perhaps the first high profile instance of this occurring today, with one of the largest football betting sites in the world, http://fixtures365.com/ having been suspended for failing to validate their contact info:\\nThis policy is mandatory for any registrars who have executed the 2013 ICANN RAA, so far Godaddy, Tucows and (apparently) 123Reg have done so.\\nNOTE: easyDNS has not yet executed the 2013 RAA, but we will later this year (we have to) so obviously, we'll try to come up with a humane way of killing your websites when you dismiss the \\\"verify your contact details\\\" emails as obvious phishing attempts or spam.\\nUpdate\\nThe \\\"suspended domain\\\" page now says\\u2026\\n\\\"This domain has been verified.

If I can sum up the problems with this in three broad points:\\nNumber #1) It may not be a big deal to require a verification step in order for something to start working, however introducing a verification step out of the blue as a requirement for something to continue working is another matter entirely and almost setup to lose.\\nNumber #2) People well versed in \\\"internet stuff\\\" train themselves and their clients to not click on links sent via email.

Criminals don't keep their whois records up to date. Forcing them to click on a link to verify a throw-away email address won't eliminate cybercrime.

For the last few years, then, my GitHub account has become more of a public portfolio and mirror of a selection of my private repos. As of today, my GitHub account is deprecated. If you want to see what I'm working on now you can go to my Projects page. I'll be gradually moving old projects over to this page, and new projects will show up there first.\\nImplementation\\nThe projects page has three moving pieces. The git repos themselves, read-only public clone access, and finally displaying the projects on the page.\\nFor the git repos, I was able to just re-use the puppet recipe I put together to install Gitolite on my Mac mini. It has a much simpler config because it just needs dynamic repos and no other crazy hooks.\\nTo add read-only clone access I turned to a project named Grack. Grack implements git's smart HTTP protocol as a Rack handler which makes it super simple to add to bugsplat.rb, the software that runs this site. Here's what config.rb looks like:\\nrequire'dotenv'Dotenv.loadrequire'app'require'grack'grack_config=project_root:ENV['PROJECTS_REPOS_ROOT'],adapter:Grack::GitAdapter,git_path:ENV['GIT_BINARY'],upload_packtrueputsgrack_configto_jsonuseRack:ShowExceptionsrunRack:URLMapnew'/'=>Appnew'/source'=>Gracknewgrack_config\\nEvery git repo in the directory named by PROJECTS_REPOS_ROOT is available for read-only public cloning.\\nTo display these repos, I added a new Project class.

Easy code and commit browsing are both huge features that I'd like to add at some point. I thought about using which has all kinds of nice features, but hacking things together is kind of my thing.\\nI realize that it's a little ironic that most of the links in this post point at GitHub. My reasons for moving to this system are pretty simple: I want to control my own destiny, free of even the possibility that someone else will be able to decide how or what I choose to share with the world.\\nFor a lot of people, GitHub or Bitbucket or another 3rd party service presents a reasonable compromise for them, and that's fine.

They independently financed the development and testing of five full versions of the Microfactory, resulting in the exceptional product featured here. The Microfactory was entirely conceived, designed and built by people who have spent their lives around machines, who wanted to make something truly revolutionary and highly usable for makers everywhere.\\nIntroducing the Microfactory: a capable of:\\nprinting functional parts in four colors or multiple materials\\nAND computerized etching\\nAND computer-controlled milling!\\nAnd check out some of the special features we've built in:\\nPort for a shop-vac hose so the machine \\\"cleans up after itself\\\" while it runs\\nNoise-reducing housing with safety-stop button\\nFull on-board computer -- no separate hardware or software needed! Connect and control through any (wired) network.\\nHigh-quality industry standard software built right in\\nUse the \\u201cMachine Shop In A Box\\u201d, the first machine to combine additive and subtractive machining in one package, to unleash your most innovative ideas! Some of the possibilities include:\\nprinting a jig to hold parts for machining\\nmilling precision features into printed parts\\nprinting in layered colors / materials and milling through the layers to create beautiful designs\\n...and much, much more!\\nThe Microfactory isn't the cheapest machine on the market, but we think it's well worth the money for people serious about making things.\\nHere's a taste of some of the decisions that went into making the Microfactory special -- what we like to call the \\\"awesome sauce\\\":\\nThe Microfactory contains a fully-capable on-board computer -- not a microcontroller! It has external connections for USB, Ethernet, and everything you\\u2019d need to run it like a complete, standalone machine on your network.\\nThe software the Microfactory runs is based on Linux CNC, with some upgrades to give it the capabilities necessary to control the machine\\u2019s unique components. We love how open source gives you the freedom and flexiblity to take the Microfactory to the next level!\\nLower-end 3D printers and similar machines use belts and pulleys to control their mechanical axes. The Microfactory, though, uses acme-threaded screws similar to those found in industrial milling machines. This lets us achieve higher forces and greater precision.\\nIf you stuck a milling head on a regular 3D printer, which incorporates a movable tray into its Z-axis, you would quickly encounter precision problems due to the pressure of the miller throwing the tray out of alignment. The Microfactory is built more like an industrial-strength milling machine, with a stable Z-axis tray on strong rails.\\nThe Microfactory is built factory-tough. In our video you can see a 350-lb gentleman standing on it -- that\\u2019s not a stunt! The chassis went through many revisions to make sure it can handle real-world makers and their real, tough projects. For extra heavy-duty conditions, the Microfactory can be upgraded to an all-metal chassis as well.\\nBesides the noise-reducing chassis you can see in our video, the Microfactory has neoprene gasketing around the openings to further insulate the sound. We\\u2019ve tried to think of these details throughout -- the little things that make this not just a cool and innovative, but friendly and usable machine.\\nThe big red rudolph-y button on the front isn\\u2019t just for show -- it\\u2019s a serious safety feature that just happens to also look cool. (It\\u2019s fun to hit, too - you should try it at least once.)\\nThe Microfactory was made BY makers FOR makers, but we need your help to go into production. The Microfactory team has footed the bill forthe entire cost of development over the last year (sometimesworking some pretty interesting day jobs to make it happen). In order toraise the cash to hire a production staff and negotiate the best priceon your machine\\u2019s parts, we need money up front. We are preselling a\\nPlease support our campaign, and help us bring about thepersonalized manufacturing revolution!\\nMachine Specs\\nprints functional parts in four colors or multiple materials in 2 colors\\n4-spool side rack for extrusion materials\\n300W spindle for computerized etching and milling of plastics and wood\\nplywood frame, 25\\u201d wide x 29\\u201d deep x 25.5\\u201d tall\\nwork volume 12\\\"x12\\\"x6\\\"\\nsturdy enclosure tested to support 350lbs, reduces noise output by ~10db\\nvacuum port for standard 2.5\\u201d shop vac + filtered air inlet with replaceable cartridge\\nsafety features: fully enclosed moving parts; covered drive belts & motors\\nopen pulleys to protect motor and frame\\nprofessional industrial motion-control package for high precision & machine reliability\\nswappable pallets for batch printing\\ninternal dedicated networkable computer (no standalone computer required!)\\nruns industry-standard gcode on a customized open-source system (cross-compatible with machine-shop mills)\\nPorts: 4x USB 2.0, VGA, Ethernet Power\\nFor more information please visit our\\nCurrently, we have several working prototypes of the Microfactory. There are a few technical items that need finishing, and then we\\u2019ll be ready to begin the process of preparing the Microfactory for large-scale production. Below is a rough timeline that you can use to follow along with us as we move from completing R&D into manufacturing. Make sure you sign up for our mailing list so that you get all the latest updates!\\nOur core team will be expanded to include several specialists who can help us finalize some of the custom software as well as beginning the process of taking a very cool handmade prototype and turning into a mass-producable machine with detailed instructions, packaging, etc.\\nMILESTONES:\\nHire a team of 3-6 engineers to finalize the technical aspects & documentation of the machine for production\\nFinalize the design\\nComplete testing run of finalized design\\nBegin the process of creating the user manual(s) and user-downloadable content\\nWith the addition of some manufacturing and operations staff, we plan to use this time to create tooling and begin the production process. This early production phase will involve a lot of testing and documentation to ensure that the shipped units are as perfect as they can be.\\nMILESTONES:\\nFinalize the supply chain\\nFinalize the assembly procedure\\nSet up the final assembly location\\nFinish the first incarnation of the user manual / content & collect feedback\\nThe real production run begins here! We will be completing orders and carefully testing and packaging all of the pre-ordered Microfactories for shipping. (Our dedicated early backers will receive the first units off the line according to their reward status.) During this time, we will also be conducting a major website expansion to include community forums, detailed do-it-yourself instructions, and downloadable content for making all the cool stuff we can think of.\\nMILESTONES:\\nBegin shipping units! (Simplified Microfactory ships in July; the full version in September/October)\\nFinalize user manual\\nOverhaul website, adding user manual and downloadable content\\nIt is important to us that you are happy with the Microfactory when you receive it! We have a big vision for making the Microfactory a versatile and easy to use machine, but it\\u2019s not, in its early stages, for everyone. Microfactory 1.0 is designed for people who have some basic experience with machine tools. Below are some special aspects of the machine that you should think about and be conceptually comfortable with when purchasing this first incarnation of the Microfactory.\\nThe Microfactory runs industry standard g-code on an open source platform: a highly-customized version of LinuxCNC. This is cool because you can run the same programs you would on common CNC tools you would find in your average machine shop. However, you should be comfortable with the following workflow: To create a part, you can either download a file (from a place like Thingiverse) to make on your Microfactory or make your own file from scratch.\\nTo make a milling or etching file, create the part in your favorite CAD (Computer-Aided Design: i.e. Solidworks, AutoCAD etc\\u2026) program or download something you want to make form the Internet and then use a CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing: i.e. CamBam etc\\u2026) program to create your subtractive machining g-code tool path. For printing, make your part in the desired CAD program or download it from the Internet and then use a g-code generator such as Slic3r to create your tool path. Both milling and printing files can be opened in our version of LinuxCNC and run. All of the steps in this process can be done with a freely downloadable program. Also, it is important to note that the machine prints in four colors, but you have to manually designate the colors. One of the things we will be spending time and money on if successfully funded is writing a program for your Microfactory which will automate this process. If your early-version Microfactory does not include this functionality, you will be provided with a free software upgrade when it is available; but do be aware that the process may temporarily be manual.\\nIt is really important that you get good adhesion to the printing surface on the first layer of any print. While adhesion is a function of many factors (bed temperature, smoothness and treatment of the printing surface, etc\\u2026) one of the most important aspects is proper machine calibration. In an effort to reduce costs, the Microfactory\\u2019s print head is manually calibrated. This is done by loosening or tightening one of four spring-loaded screws (one for each print head) connecting the nozzle block to the gantry.\\nThis is not a terribly laborious process, but is an essential part of proper machine operation. If we are successfully funded, we would like to further simplify/improve this configuration to reduce the overall amount of calibration required over the lifetime of your machine; however, early versions of the Microfactory may require manual calibration.\\nAs you can see from the video, the space between the milling heads and the printing heads is relatively small. One of the benefits of the Microfactory is that you never need to remove the printing head when you change over to a milling operation (and vice-versa). This saves you a lot of time and makes the machine much more user friendly. However, the proximity of the print and milling heads means that extra care may be required when adding or changing milling tools. We ask that you use common sense when putting in a milling bit after finishing a printing operation. Turn the print heads off and give them an opportunity to cool before trying to insert the milling bit.\\nThe international response to this project has been wonderful! We want to express our gratitude to all of the supportive people outside the US who have gotten excited about what we are doing. We REALLY want to get Microfactories to you, and see all of the amazingly creative things you build with them. But we are facing a dillema!!! Kickstarter does not support flexible shipping and tax options based on the country you are ordering from. We have been wrestling with what to do about this. We need to be realistic about the fact that we are a very small company on a very tight budget, and we apologize for the international shipping charge being as expensive as it is. That charge reflects both shipping (for the sizable Microfactory) and import taxes for a wide range of destinations. If this fee is prohibitively high compared to the actual shipping and taxes you would pay for your country, we encourage you to wait until the machines are made available to the general public.\\nThe Mebotics team conceived, designed, built (and tested and rebuilt and tested and rebuilt...) the Microfactory over the course of a year of hard unpaid work and dedication. The next step is take the next step and build up the infrastructure to finish and manufacture our machines. With this in mind, we have turned to Kickstarter with three goals:\\n1) Use pre-orders to determine if people are interested in having a machine with the Microfactory's unique capabilities 2) Secure the funding to hire a few more key team members to help us finish up aspects of the machine's software and hardware\\nWhen manufacturing a new device, there are always challenges related to part procurement, price negotiation, quality control, staffing, assembly and shipping. There will no doubt be some re-engineering and part substitution related to these issues, but we have experience bringing products to market, and we believe that we possess the right mix of skills to address these issues.\\nWe are very proud of how far we have come on our own, but without outside investment money, we have limited resources. We are committed to bringing you the highest quality machines, and to do that we need a full time staff. Our funding goal reflects what we believe to be the realistic minimum which will allow us to buy the parts for your Microfactory AND to hire the people to ensure that something really amazing arrives at your doorstep.\",\"title\":\"The Microfactory: A machine shop in a

things. &nbsp;Here's a taste of some of the decisions that went into making the Microfactory special -- what we like to call the &quot;awesome sauce&quot;:&nbsp;<\\/b><\\/p>\\n<ul><li>\\n  The Microfactory contains a fully-capable on-board computer -- not a microcontroller!  It has external connections for USB, Ethernet, and everything you&rsquo;d need to run it like a complete, standalone machine on your network.&nbsp;<\\/li><\\/ul><ul><li>\\n  The software the Microfactory runs is based on Linux CNC, with some upgrades to give it the capabilities necessary to control the machine&rsquo;s unique components.  We love how open source gives you the freedom and flexiblity to take the Microfactory to the next level!&nbsp;<\\/li><\\/ul><ul><li>\\n  Lower-end 3D printers and similar machines use belts and pulleys to control their mechanical axes.  The Microfactory, though, uses acme-threaded screws similar to those found in industrial milling machines.  This lets us achieve higher forces and greater precision.&nbsp;<\\/li><\\/ul><ul><li>\\n  If you stuck a milling head on a regular 3D printer, which incorporates a movable tray into its Z-axis, you would quickly encounter precision problems due to the pressure of the miller throwing the tray out of alignment.  The Microfactory is built more like an industrial-strength milling machine, with a stable Z-axis tray on strong rails.&nbsp;<\\/li><\\/ul><ul><li>\\n  The Microfactory is built factory-tough.  In our video you can see a 350-lb gentleman standing on it -- that&rsquo;s not a stunt!  The chassis went through many revisions to make sure it can handle real-world makers and their real, tough projects.  For extra heavy-duty conditions, the Microfactory can be upgraded to an all-metal chassis as well.&nbsp;\\n<\\/li><\\/ul><ul><li>\\n  Besides the noise-reducing chassis you can see in our video, the Microfactory has neoprene gasketing around the openings to further insulate the sound.  We&rsquo;ve tried to think of these details throughout -- the little things that make this not just a cool and innovative, but friendly and usable machine.&nbsp;<\\/li><\\/ul><ul><li>\\n  The big red rudolph-y button on the front isn&rsquo;t just for show -- it&rsquo;s a serious safety feature that just happens to also look cool.  (It&rsquo;s fun to hit, too - you should try it at least once.)&nbsp;<\\/li><\\/ul><p><br>The Microfactory was made BY makers FOR makers, but we need your help&nbsp;to go into production. The Microfactory team has footed the bill for<br>the entire cost of development over the last year (sometimes<br>working some pretty interesting day jobs to make it happen). In order to<br>raise the cash to hire a production staff and negotiate the best price<br>on your machine&rsquo;s parts, we need money up front.

(Simplified Microfactory ships in July; the full version in September/October)<\\/li>\\n<li>Finalize user manual<\\/li>\\n<li>Overhaul website, adding user manual and downloadable content<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul><p>It is important to us that you are happy with the Microfactory when you receive it! &nbsp;We have a big vision for making the Microfactory a versatile and easy to use machine, but it&rsquo;s not, in its early stages, for everyone. Microfactory 1.0 is designed for people who have some basic experience with machine tools. Below are some special aspects of the machine that you should think about and be conceptually comfortable with when purchasing this first incarnation of the Microfactory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p><p>The Microfactory runs industry standard g-code on an open source platform: a highly-customized version of LinuxCNC. This is cool because you can run the same programs you would on common CNC tools you would find in your average machine shop. However, you should be comfortable with the following workflow: &nbsp;To create a part, you can either download a file (from a place like Thingiverse) to make on your Microfactory or make your own file from scratch. <\\/p><p>To make a milling or etching file, create the part in your favorite CAD (Computer-Aided Design: i.e. Solidworks, AutoCAD etc&hellip;) program or download something you want to make form the Internet and then use a CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing: i.e. CamBam etc&hellip;) program to create your subtractive machining g-code tool path. For printing, make your part in the desired CAD program or download it from the Internet and then use a g-code generator such as Slic3r to create your tool path. Both milling and printing files can be opened in our version of LinuxCNC and run. All of the steps in this process can be done with a freely downloadable program. Also, it is important to note that the machine prints in four colors, but you have to manually designate the colors. One of the things we will be spending time and money on if successfully funded is writing a program for your Microfactory which will automate this process. &nbsp;If your early-version Microfactory does not include this functionality, you will be provided with a free software upgrade when it is available; but do be aware that the process may temporarily be manual.<\\/p><p>It is really important that you get good adhesion to the printing surface on the first layer of any print. While adhesion is a function of many factors (bed temperature, smoothness and treatment of the printing surface, etc&hellip;) one of the most important aspects is proper machine calibration. In an effort to reduce costs, the Microfactory&rsquo;s print head is manually calibrated. This is done by loosening or tightening one of four spring-loaded screws (one for each print head) connecting the nozzle block to the gantry. <\\/p><p>This is not a terribly laborious process, but is an essential part of proper machine operation. If we are successfully funded, we would like to further simplify/improve this configuration to reduce the overall amount of calibration required over the lifetime of your machine; however, early versions of the Microfactory may require manual calibration.<\\/p><p>As you can see from the video, the space between the milling heads and the printing heads is relatively small. One of the benefits of the Microfactory is that you never need to remove the printing head when you change over to a milling operation (and vice-versa). This saves you a lot of time and makes the machine much more user friendly. &nbsp;However, the proximity of the print and milling heads means that extra care may be required when adding or changing milling tools. &nbsp;We ask that you use common sense when putting in a milling bit after finishing a printing operation. Turn the print heads off and give them an opportunity to cool before trying to insert the milling bit.<\\/p><p>The international response to this project has been wonderful! We want to express our gratitude to all of the supportive people outside the US who have gotten excited about what we are doing. We REALLY want to get Microfactories to you, and see all of the amazingly creative things you build with them. &nbsp;But we are facing a dillema!!! Kickstarter does not support flexible shipping and tax options based on the country you are ordering from. We have been wrestling with what to do about this. We need to be realistic about the fact that we are a very small company on a very tight budget, and we apologize for the international shipping charge being as expensive as it is. That charge reflects both shipping (for the sizable Microfactory) and import taxes for a wide range of destinations. &nbsp;If this fee is prohibitively high compared to the actual shipping and taxes you would pay for your country, we encourage you to wait until the machines are made available to the general public.<\\/p>\\n<\\/div><div id=\\\"risks\\\">\\n\\n<p><\\/p><p>The Mebotics team conceived, designed, built (and tested and rebuilt and tested and rebuilt...) the Microfactory over the course of a year of hard unpaid work and dedication. The next step is take the next step and build up the infrastructure to finish and manufacture our machines. With this in mind, we have turned to Kickstarter with three goals:<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>1) Use pre-orders to determine if people are interested in having a machine with the Microfactory's unique capabilities\\n<br>2) Secure the funding to hire a few more key team members to help us finish up aspects of the machine's software and hardware\\n<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>When manufacturing a new device, there are always challenges related to part procurement, price negotiation, quality control, staffing, assembly and shipping. There will no doubt be some re-engineering and part substitution related to these issues, but we have experience bringing products to market, and we believe that we possess the right mix of skills to address these issues. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>We are very proud of how far we have come on our own, but without outside investment money, we have limited resources. We are committed to bringing you the highest quality machines, and to do that we need a full time staff. Our funding goal reflects what we believe to be the realistic minimum which will allow us to buy the parts for your Microfactory AND to hire the people to ensure that something really amazing arrives at your doorstep.<\\/p><p><\\/p>\\n<\\/div><\\/div>\",\"date\":\"Fri, 27 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT\",\"type\":\"article\",\"url\":\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/327919589/the-microfactory-a-machine-shop-in-a-box\"}",

Unlike the recently announced SR-72, the new RQ-180 from Northrop Grumman is believed to be currently in flight testing according to Aviation Week and Space Technology.\\nThe RQ-180 is a new design aimed at intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR, a.k.a. spying) and incorporates stealth technology, in addition to an efficient new design that\\u2019s tailored to flights over countries where the red carpet isn\\u2019t being rolled out for current U.S. spy drones.\\nIt\\u2019s the successor to the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel, known as the \\u201cBeast of Kandahar\\u201d for its countless missions out of Afghanistan since 2007. It is assumed the RQ-170 has flown missions over Iran and Pakistan, but the aircraft lacks the endurance of other unmanned aircraft, somewhat limiting its capabilities. Iran displayed what is claimed to be a captured RQ-170 in December 2011. The U.S. Air Force would only acknowledge that it lost control of an RQ-170 over western Afghanistan at the same time.\\nThe new RQ-180 is thought to largely address the problem of flying in hostile airspace through improved stealth design and better aerodynamics. According to Aviation Week, the unmanned spy plane would allow the Air Force to expand ISR capabilities beyond the \\u201cpermissive environments \\u2014 such as Iraq and Afghanistan,\\u201d where current drones such as the Global Hawk and Predator/Reaper operate. Instead the RQ-180 would be able to fly undetected in airspace where the U.S. does not have permission and/or the protection needed to fly.\\nThis denied airspace capability has been missing from the Air Force\\u2019s inventory since the speedy SR-71 retired in 1998. The Blackbird mainly relied on its speed and altitude \\u2014 along with some stealth-like qualities \\u2014 to fly over countries and gather intelligence where the U.S. was not welcome.\\nAviation Week points to financial reports from Northrop Grumman that suggest the possibility of the new airplane, as well as satellite images of the company\\u2019s facility in Palmdale, California and Area 51 that show new hangars capable of holding aircraft with a wingspan of at least 130 feet \\u2014 larger than a Boeing 737. When asked about the existence of the RQ-180, the Air Force told the trade publication that it \\u201cdoes not discuss this program.\\u201d\\nThe use of unmanned aircraft for spying continues to rise year after year. But most of the work is done by slow flying aircraft such as the Global Hawk and Predators. In addition to flying relatively slow, these airplanes are also far from invisible to radar.

Unlike the <a href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/11/lockheed-martin-sr-72/\\\">recently announced SR-72<\\/a>, the new RQ-180 from Northrop Grumman <a href=\\\"http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_12_06_2013_p0-643783.xml\\\">is believed to be currently in flight testing<\\/a> according to <em>Aviation Week and Space Technology<\\/em>.<\\/p>\\n<p>The RQ-180 is a new design aimed at intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR, a.k.a. spying) and incorporates stealth technology, in addition to an efficient new design that&rsquo;s tailored to flights over countries where the red carpet isn&rsquo;t being rolled out for current U.S. spy drones.<\\/p>\\n<p>It&rsquo;s the successor to the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel, known as the &ldquo;<a href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/01/return-of-the-beast-of-kandahar-stealth-drone/\\\">Beast of Kandahar<\\/a>&rdquo; for its countless missions out of Afghanistan since 2007. It is assumed the RQ-170 has flown missions over Iran and Pakistan, but the aircraft lacks the endurance of other unmanned aircraft, somewhat limiting its capabilities. Iran displayed what is <a href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/12/iran-did-capture-a-secret-u-s-drone/\\\">claimed to be a captured RQ-170<\\/a> in December 2011. The U.S. Air Force would only acknowledge that it lost control of an RQ-170 over western Afghanistan at the same time.<\\/p>\\n<p>The new RQ-180 is thought to largely address the problem of flying in hostile airspace through improved stealth design and better aerodynamics. According to <a href=\\\"http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_12_06_2013_p0-643783.xml\\\"><em>Aviation Week<\\/em><\\/a>, the unmanned spy plane would allow the Air Force to expand ISR capabilities beyond the &ldquo;permissive environments &mdash; such as Iraq and Afghanistan,&rdquo; where current drones such as the <a href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/06/it-was-march-madness-for-global-hawk-spy-drone/\\\">Global Hawk<\\/a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/graham-drones/predator-reaper-unit-becomes-air-expeditionary-wing/\\\">Predator/Reaper<\\/a> operate. Instead the RQ-180 would be able to fly undetected in airspace where the U.S. does not have permission and/or the protection needed to fly.<\\/p>\\n<p>This denied airspace capability has been missing from the Air Force&rsquo;s inventory since the speedy SR-71 retired in 1998. The <a href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/09/0901sr-71-blackbird-transatlantic-record/\\\">Blackbird mainly relied on its speed<\\/a> and altitude &mdash; along with some stealth-like qualities &mdash; to fly over countries and gather intelligence where the U.S. was not welcome.<\\/p>\\n<p><em>Aviation Week<\\/em> points to financial reports from Northrop Grumman that suggest the possibility of the new airplane, as well as satellite images of the company&rsquo;s facility in Palmdale, California and Area 51 that show new hangars capable of holding aircraft with a wingspan of at least 130 feet &mdash; larger than a Boeing 737. When asked about the existence of the RQ-180, the Air Force told the trade publication that it &ldquo;does not discuss this program.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>The use of unmanned aircraft for spying continues to rise year after year. But most of the work is done by slow flying aircraft such as the Global Hawk and Predators. In addition to flying relatively slow, these airplanes are also far from invisible to radar. Most of their use has been limited to flying over areas where manned fighter aircraft are able to control the skies, providing protection for the vulnerable drones.<\\/p>\\n<p>The RQ-180 on the other hand is expected to have a stealth design with greatly improved aerodynamics giving it greater efficiency, which in the case of ISR work, translates to longer missions which could include longer transits to a target area, or more time over the target.<\\/p>\\n<p>Northrop Grumman has also been publicly flight testing its X-47B unmanned combat aircraft, including <a href=\\\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/05/drone-carrier/\\\">take offs and landings from an aircraft carrier<\\/a>.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://libcom.org/files/favicon.ico\",\"text\":\"THE TYRANNY OF TYRANNY\\nAn article entitled 'The Tyranny of Structurelessness' which has received wide attention around the women's movement, (in MS, Second Wave etc) assails the trend towards 'leaderless', 'structureless' groups, as the main - if not sole - organisational form of the movement, as a dead-end. While written and received in good faith, as an aid to the movement, the article is destructive in its distortion and maligning of a valid, conscious strategy for building a revolutionary movement. It is high time that we recognise the direction these tendencies are pointing in, as a real political alternative to hierarchical organisation, rather than trying to nip it in the bud.\\nThere are (at least) two different models for building a movement, only one of which does Joreen acknowledge: a mass organisation with strong, centralised control, such as a Party. The other model, which consolidates mass support only as a coup de grace necessity, is based on small groups in voluntary association.\\nA large group functions as an aggregate of its parts - each member functions as a unit, a cog in the wheel of the large organisation. The individual is alienated by the size, and relegated, to struggling against the obstacle created by the size of the group - as example, expending energy to get a point of view recognised.\\nSmall groups, on the other hand, multiply the strength of each member. By working collectively in small numbers, the small group utilises the various contributions of each person to their fullest, nurturing and developing individual input, instead of dissipating it in the competitive survival-of-the-fittest/smartest/wittiest spirit of the large organisation.\\nJoreen associates the ascendency of the small groups with the consciousness-raising phase of the women's movement, but concludes that, with the focus shifting beyond the changing of individual consciousness towards building a mass revolutionary movement, women should begin working towards building a large organisation. It is certainly true and has been for some time that many women who have been in consciousness-raising groups for a while feel the need to expand their political activities beyond the scope of the group and are at a loss as to how to proceed. But it is equally true that other branches of the Left are at a similar loss, as to how to defeat capitalist, imperialist, quasi-fascist Amerika.\\nBut Joreen fails to define what she means by the women's movement, which is an essential prerequisite to a discussion of strategy or direction.\\nThe feminist movement in its fullest sense, that is, as a movement to defeat Patriarchy, is a revolutionary movement and a socialist movement, Placing it under the umbrella of the Left. A central problem Of women determining strategy for the women's movement is how to relate to the male Left; we do not want to take their, Modus Operandi as ours, because we have seen them as a perpetuation of patriarchal, and latterly, capitalist values.\\nDespite our best efforts to disavow and dissassociate ourselves from the male Left, we have, nonetheless, had our energy. Men tend to organise the way they fuck - one big rush and then that \\\"wham, slam, thank you maam\\\", as it were. Women should be building our movement the way we make love - gradually, with sustained involvement, limitless endurance - and of course, multiple orgasms. Instead of getting discouraged and isolated now, we should be in our small groups - discussing, Planning, creating and making trouble. We should always be making trouble for patriarchy and always supporting women - we should always be actively engaging in and creating feminist activity, because we ail thrive on it; in the absence of feminist activity, women take to tranquillizers, go insane and commit suicide.\\nThe other extreme from inactivity, which seems to plague Politically active people, is over-involvement, which led, in the late '60s, to a generation of burnt-out radicals. A feminist friend once commented that, to her, \\\"being in the women's movement\\\" meant spending approximately 25% of her time engaging in group activities and 75% of her time developing herself. This is a real, important time allocation for 'movement' women to think about. The male movement taught us that 'movement' People are supposed to devote 24 hours a day to the Cause, which is consistent with female socialisation towards self-sacrifice. Whatever the source of our selflessness, however, we tend to plunge ourselves head-first into organisational activities, neglecting personal development, until one day we find we do not know what we are doing and for whose benefit, and we hate ourselves as much as before the movement. (Male over-involvement, on the other hand, obviously unrelated to any sex-linked trait of self-sacrifice, does however smell strongly of the Protestant/Jewish, work/ achievement ethic, and even more flagrantly, of the rational, cool, unemotional facade with which Machismo suppresses male feelings.)\\nThese perennial Pitfalls of movement people, which amount to a bottomless Pit for the movement, are explained by Joreen as part of the 'Tyranny of Structurelessness', which is a joke from the standpoint that sees a nation of quasi-automatons, struggling to maintain a semblanceof individuality against a post-technological, military/industrial bulldozer.\\nWhat we definitely don't need is more structures and rules, providing us with easy answers, pre-fab alternatives and no room in which to create our own way of life. What is threatening the female Left and the other branches even more, is the 'tyranny of tyranny', which has prevented us from relating to individuals, or from creating organisations in ways that do not obliterate individuality with prescribed roles, or from liberating us from capitalist structure.\\nContrary to Joreen's assumption, then, the consciousness-raising phase of the movement is not over. Consciousness-raising is a vital process which must go on, among those engaged in social change, to and through the revolutionary liberation. Raising our consciousness - meaning, helping each other extricate ourselves from ancient shackles - is the main way in which women are going to turn their personal anger into constructive energy, and join the struggle. Consciousness-raising, however, is a loose term - a vacuous nothingism, at this point - and needs to be qualified. An offensive television commercial can raise a women's consciousness as she irons her husbands shirts alone in her house; it can remind her of what she already knows, ie that she is trapped, her life is meaningless, boring, etc - but it will probably not encourage her to leave the laundry and organise a houseworkers' strike. Consciousness-raising, as a strategy for revolution, just involve helping women translate their personal dissatisfaction into class-consciousness and making organised women accessible to all women.\\nIn suggesting that the next step after consciousness-raising groups is building a movement, Joreen not only implies a false dichotomy between one and the other, but also overlooks an important process of the feminist movement, that of building a women's culture. While, ultimately, a massive force of women (and some men) will be necessary to smash the power of the state, a mass movement itself does not a revolution make. If we hope to create a society free of mate supremacy, when we overthrow capitalism and build international socialism, we had better start working on it right away, because some of our very best anti-capitalist friends are going to give us the hardest time. We must be developing a visible women's culture, within which women can define and express themselves apart from patriarchal standards, and which will meet the needs of women where patriarchy has failed.\\nCulture is an essential part of a revolutionary movement - and it is also one of the greatest tools of counter-revolution. We must be very careful to specify that the culture we are discussing is revolutionary, and struggle constantly to make sure it remains inveterately opposed to the father culture.\\nThe culture of an oppressed or colonised class or caste is not necessarily revolutionary. America contains - both in the sense of 'having' and in preventing the spread of - many 'sub-cultures' which, though defining themselves as different from the father culture, do not threaten the status quo. In fact, they are part of the 'pluralistic' American one-big-happy-family society/ethnic cultures, the 'counter-culture'. They are acknowledged, validated, adopted and ripped off by the big culture. Co-opation.\\nThe women's culture faces that very danger right now, from a revolutionary new liberating girdle to MS magazine, to The Diary of a Mad Housewife. The New Woman, ie middle-class, college-educated,mate-associated can have her share of the American Pie. Sounds scrumptious - but what about revolution? We must constantly re-evaluate our position to make sure we are not being absorbed into Uncle Sam's ever-open arms.\\nThe question of women's culture, while denigrated by the arrogant and blind male Left, is not necessarily a revisionist issue. The polarisation between masculine and feminine roles as defined and controlled by male society, has not only subjugated women, but has made all men, regardless of class or race, feel superior to women - this feeling of superiority, countering anti-capitalist sentiment, is the lifeblood of the system. The aim of feminist revolution is for women to achieve our total humanity, which means destroying the masculine and feminine roles which make both men and women only half human. Creating a woman's culture is the means through which we shall restore our lost humanity.\\nThe question of our lost humanity brings up the subject that vulgar Marxists of every predilection have neglected in their analysis for over half century - the psycho-sexual elements in the character structure of each individual, which acts as a personal policeman within every member of society. Wilhelm Reich began to describe, in narrow, heterosexual, male-biased form, the character armour in each person, which makes people good fascists or, in our society, just good citizens. Women experience this phenomenon every day, as the repressed feelings, especially obvious among our male friends, who find it so difficult to express or even 'expose' their feelings honestly. The psychic crippling which capitalist psychology coerces us into believing is the problems of the individuals, is a massive social condition which helps advanced capitalist society to hold together.\\nPsychic crippling of its citizens makes its citizens report to work, fight in wars, suppress its women, non-whites, and all non-conformists vulnerable to suppression. In our post-technological society, every member of which recognises this as being the most advanced culture, the psychic crippling is also the most advanced - there is more shit for the psyche to cut through, what with Jonathan Livingston Seaquil and the politics of 'You're okay, I'm okay', not to mention post-neo-Freudians and the psycho-surgeons. For the umpteenth time, let it be said that, unless we examine inner psychic shackles, at the time we study outer, political structures and the relationship between the two, we will not succeed in creating a force to challenge our enemy; in fact, we will not even know the enemy. The Left has spent hours and tomes trying to define the ruling class; tee ruling class has representative pigs inside the head of every member of society -thus, the logic behind so-called paranoia. The tyranny of tyranny is a deeply-entrenched foe.\\nWhere psychological struggle intersects political involvement is the small group. This is why the question of strategy and tactics and methods of organisation are so crucial at this moment. The Left has been trying for decades to rally people into the streets, always before a number sufficient to make a dent exist. As Stone pointed out, you can't make a revolution when four-fifths of the people are happy. Nor should we wait until everyone is ready to become radical. While on the one hand, we should constantly suggest alternatives to capitalism, through food co-ops, anti-corporate actions and acts of personal rebellion, we should also be fighting against capitalist psychic structures and the values and living patterns which derive from them. Structures, chairmen, leaders, rhetoric - when a meeting of a Leftist group becomes indistinguishable in style from a session of a US Senate, we should not laugh about it, but re-evaluate the structure behind the style, and recognise a representative of the enemy.\\nThe origin of the small group preference in the women's movement -and by small group I refer to political collectives - was, as Joreen explains, a reaction against the over-structured, hierachical organisation of society in general, and male Left groups in particular. But what people fail to realise is that we are reacting against bureaucracy because it deprives us of control, like the rest of this society; and instead of recognising the folly of our ways by returning to the structured fold, we who are rebelling against bureaucracy should be creating an alternative to bureaucratic organisation. The reason for building a movement on a foundation of collectives is that we want to create a revolutionary culture consistent with our view of the new society; it is more than a reaction; the small group is a solution.\\nBecause the women's movement is tending towards small groups and because the women's movement lacks direction at this time, some people conclude that small groups are to blame for the lack of direction. They wave the shibboleth of 'structure' as a solution to the strategic stalemate, as if structure would give us theoretical insight or relief from personal anxieties. it might give us a structure into which to 'organise', or fit more women, but in the absence of political strategy we may create a Kafkaesque irony, where the trial is replaced by a meeting.\\nThe lack of political energy that has been stalking us for the last few years, less in the women's movement than in the male Left, probably relates directly to feelings of personal shittiness that tyrannize each and every one of us. Unless we confront those feelings directly and treat them with the same seriousness as we treat the bombing of Hanoi, paralysis by the former will prevent us from retaliating effectively against the latter.\\nRather than calling for the replacement of small groups with structured, larger groups, we need to encourage each other to get settled into small, unstructured groups which recognise and extol the value of the individual. Friendships, more than therapy of any kind, instantly relieve the feelings of personal shittiness - the revolution should be built on the model of friendships.\\nThe omnipresent problem which Joreen confronts, that of elites, does not find solution in the formation of structures. Contrary to the belief that lack of up-front structures lead to insidious, invisible structures based on elites, the absence of structures in small, mutual trust groups fights elitism on the basic level - the level of personal dynamics, at which the individual who counters insecurity with aggressive behaviour rules over the person whose insecurity maintains silence. The small personally involved group learns, first to recognise those stylistic differences, and then to appreciate and work with them; rather than trying to either ignore or annihilate differences in personal style, the small group learns to appreciate and utilise them, thus strengthening the personal power of each individual. Given that each of us has been socialised in a society in Which individual competition with every other individual is the way of existence, we are not going to obliterate personal-styles-as-power, except by constant recognition of these differences, and by learning to let differences of personal style exist together. Insofar as we are not the enemy, but the victims, we need to nurture and not destroy each other. The destructive elements will recede gradually as we grow stronger. But in the meantime we should guard against situations which reward personal style with power.\\nMeetings award prizes to the more aggressive, rhetorical, charismatic, articulate (almost always male). Considering how much the various derivatives of the term 'anarchism' are bandied about, very few people in the Left have studied anarchism with any seriousness. For people priding themselves on cynicism about social taboos, we sure are sucked in by this taboo against anarchism.\\nLike masturbation, anarchism is something we have been brought up to fear, irrationally and unquestioningly, because not to fear it might lead us to probe it, learn it and like it. For anyone who has ever considered the possibility that masturbation might provide more benefits than madness, a study of anarchism is highly recommended - all the way back to the time of Marx, when Bakunin was his most radical socialist adversary... most radical, because he was a dialectical giant step beyond Marx, trusting the qualities of individuals to save humanity.\\nWhy has the Left all but ignored anarchism? It might be because the anarchists have never sustained a revolutionary victory. Marxism has triumphed, but so has capitalism. What does that prove, or what does it suggest but that maybe the loser, up to this point is on our side? The Russian anarchists fiercely opposed the very revisionist tyranny among the Bolsheviks that the new Left would come to deride with sophomoric callousness, before their old Left parents in the '60s. Sure, the old generation of American Leftists were narrow-minded not to see capitalism regenerating in Russia; but the tunnel vision with which we have charted a path of Marxist-Leninist dogma is not something to be proud of either.\\nWomen, of course, have made it out of the tunnel way before most men, because we found ourselves in the dark, being led by the blind men of the new Left, and split. Housewife for the revolution or prostitute for the proletariats; amazing how quickly our revision restored itself. All across the country independent groups of women began functioning without the structure, leaders and other factotems of the male Left, creating independently and simultaneously, organisations similar to those of anarchists of many decades and locales. No accident either.\\nThe style, the audacity of Emma Goldman, has been touted by women who do not regard themselves as anarchists... because Emma was so right-on. Few women have gotten so many men scared for so long as Emma Goldman. It seems logical that we should study Emma, not to embrace her every thought, but to find the source of her strength and love of life. It is no accident, either, that the anarchist Red Terror named Emma was also an advocate and practitioner of free-love; she was an affront to more capitalist shackles than any of her Marxist contemporaries.\\nCathy Levine\",\"title\":\"The Tyranny of Tyranny\",\"html\":\"<div class=\\\"content grid-6 alpha\\\" id=\\\"node-page\\\">\\t\\n      <p>THE TYRANNY OF TYRANNY<\\/p>\\n<p>An article entitled 'The Tyranny of Structurelessness' which has received wide attention around the women's movement, (in MS, Second Wave etc) assails the trend towards 'leaderless', 'structureless' groups, as the main - if not sole - organisational form of the movement, as a dead-end.

But what people fail to realise is that we are reacting against bureaucracy because it deprives us of control, like the rest of this society; and instead of recognising the folly of our ways by returning to the structured fold, we who are rebelling against bureaucracy should be creating an alternative to bureaucratic organisation. The reason for building a movement on a foundation of collectives is that we want to create a revolutionary culture consistent with our view of the new society; it is more than a reaction; the small group is a solution.<\\/p>\\n<p>Because the women's movement is tending towards small groups and because the women's movement lacks direction at this time, some people conclude that small groups are to blame for the lack of direction. They wave the shibboleth of 'structure' as a solution to the strategic stalemate, as if structure would give us theoretical insight or relief from personal anxieties. it might give us a structure into which to 'organise', or fit more women, but in the absence of political strategy we may create a Kafkaesque irony, where the trial is replaced by a meeting.<\\/p>\\n<p>The lack of political energy that has been stalking us for the last few years, less in the women's movement than in the male Left, probably relates directly to feelings of personal shittiness that tyrannize each and every one of us. Unless we confront those feelings directly and treat them with the same seriousness as we treat the bombing of Hanoi, paralysis by the former will prevent us from retaliating effectively against the latter.<\\/p>\\n<p>Rather than calling for the replacement of small groups with structured, larger groups, we need to encourage each other to get settled into small, unstructured groups which recognise and extol the value of the individual. Friendships, more than therapy of any kind, instantly relieve the feelings of personal shittiness - the revolution should be built on the model of friendships.<\\/p>\\n<p>The omnipresent problem which Joreen confronts, that of elites, does not find solution in the formation of structures. Contrary to the belief that lack of up-front structures lead to insidious, invisible structures based on elites, the absence of structures in small, mutual trust groups fights elitism on the basic level - the level of personal dynamics, at which the individual who counters insecurity with aggressive behaviour rules over the person whose insecurity maintains silence. The small personally involved group learns, first to recognise those stylistic differences, and then to appreciate and work with them; rather than trying to either ignore or annihilate differences in personal style, the small group learns to appreciate and utilise them, thus strengthening the personal power of each individual. Given that each of us has been socialised in a society in Which individual competition with every other individual is the way of existence, we are not going to obliterate personal-styles-as-power, except by constant recognition of these differences, and by learning to let differences of personal style exist together. Insofar as we are not the enemy, but the victims, we need to nurture and not destroy each other. The destructive elements will recede gradually as we grow stronger. But in the meantime we should guard against situations which reward personal style with power.<\\/p>\\n<p>Meetings award prizes to the more aggressive, rhetorical, charismatic, articulate (almost always male). Considering how much the various derivatives of the term 'anarchism' are bandied about, very few people in the Left have studied anarchism with any seriousness. For people priding themselves on cynicism about social taboos, we sure are sucked in by this taboo against anarchism.<\\/p>\\n<p>Like masturbation, anarchism is something we have been brought up to fear, irrationally and unquestioningly, because not to fear it might lead us to probe it, learn it and like it. For anyone who has ever considered the possibility that masturbation might provide more benefits than madness, a study of anarchism is highly recommended - all the way back to the time of Marx, when Bakunin was his most radical socialist adversary... most radical, because he was a dialectical giant step beyond Marx, trusting the qualities of individuals to save humanity.<\\/p>\\n<p>Why has the Left all but ignored anarchism? It might be because the anarchists have never sustained a revolutionary victory. Marxism has triumphed, but so has capitalism. What does that prove, or what does it suggest but that maybe the loser, up to this point is on our side? The Russian anarchists fiercely opposed the very revisionist tyranny among the Bolsheviks that the new Left would come to deride with sophomoric callousness, before their old Left parents in the '60s. Sure, the old generation of American Leftists were narrow-minded not to see capitalism regenerating in Russia; but the tunnel vision with which we have charted a path of Marxist-Leninist dogma is not something to be proud of either.<\\/p>\\n<p>Women, of course, have made it out of the tunnel way before most men, because we found ourselves in the dark, being led by the blind men of the new Left, and split. Housewife for the revolution or prostitute for the proletariats; amazing how quickly our revision restored itself. All across the country independent groups of women began functioning without the structure, leaders and other factotems of the male Left, creating independently and simultaneously, organisations similar to those of anarchists of many decades and locales. No accident either.<\\/p>\\n<p>The style, the audacity of Emma Goldman, has been touted by women who do not regard themselves as anarchists... because Emma was so right-on. Few women have gotten so many men scared for so long as Emma Goldman. It seems logical that we should study Emma, not to embrace her every thought, but to find the source of her strength and love of life. It is no accident, either, that the anarchist Red Terror named Emma was also an advocate and practitioner of free-love; she was an affront to more capitalist shackles than any of her Marxist contemporaries.<\\/p>\\n<p>Cathy Levine <\\/p>  \\n    <\\/div>\",\"date\":\"Fri, 15 Apr 2005 05:11:00 GMT\",\"type\":\"article\",\"url\":\"http://libcom.org/library/tyranny-of-tyranny-cathy-levine\"}",

 "{\"author\":\"Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols\",\"text\":\"If there was ever any doubt that security is a process and not a product, the results of HP Zero Day Initiative's (ZDI) annual Pwn2Own hacking contest will lay those doubts to rest. All the major Web browsers\\u2014Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (IE), and Safari\\u2014were cracked by the end of the two day competition.\\nThe HP ZDI team celebrating after cracking IE 11 on a fully-patched Windows 8.1 x64 laptop. (Credit: HP ZDI)Before the Pwn2Own contest itself began, two of the game's sponsors, Google and ZDI, showed up their own browser cracks in an event called Pwn4Fun. First, Google cracked Apple Safari 7 on a fully patched version of Mac OS X Maverick like an egg. At the end of the exploit, Google was running Calculator as root.\\nZDI, for its part, showed \\\"a multi-stage exploit, including an adaptable sandbox bypass, against Microsoft Internet Explorer, launching Scientific Calculator (running in medium integrity)\\\" in IE 11 running on an up-to-date patched Windows 8.1 x64 PC. While it wasn't as complete a crack as Google's on Safari, it was still a crushing blow.\\nSome security experts objected to Google and ZDI showing off these exploits. Google security engineer Chris Evans told the security publication Threatpost that Google had shared the vulnerability with Apple beforehand. HP ZDI added that they had reported the zero day holes they used, along with six more IE security holes, to Microsoft.\\nWhen the real Pwn2Own competition began, and all the browsers and associated Web browser programs, including Adobe Flash and Reader, began to fall.\\nFirst, Firefox 27 went down to three different attacks on Windows 8.1 x64 PC. Then Team VUPEN, an elite French group of security experts, took out the latest versions of Adobe Flash and Reader, and followed this up by exploiting both other security holes in IE 11 and Firefox 27.\\nAnd that was just the first day of the competition. The next day, all the browsers, including Google Chrome, got blasted again.\\nAccording to HP's results coverage, the newly patched Chrome went down to an \\\"arbitrary read/write bug with a sandbox bypass resulting in code execution. Upon review, contest judges declared this a partial win due to one portion of the presentation\\u2019s collision with a vulnerability presented earlier at Pwnium.\\\"\\nChrome wasn't out of the woods yet. VUPEN cracked it with an attack that popped it open with a sandbox bypass, resulting in code execution, that worked against both the Blink and WebKit Web-rendering engines.\\nThe other browsers were also in for more pain. IE 11, Firefox 27, and Safari 7 all got hammered before the competition came to an end. Only one hacker prize was left unclaimed--the \\\"Unicorn\\\" of a system-level code execution on a Windows 8.1 x64, in IE 11 x64, with an Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) bypass.\\nAt Pwn2Own's end, $850,000 had been awarded to the white-hat hackers, leaving the browser developers a lot of patch work to do. The most important result of Pwn2Own as Chaouki Bekrar, VUPEN CEO told CNET, was it showed that \\\"even the most secure software can be compromised by a team of researchers with enough resources.\\\" As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, security is a process not a product.\\nNSA: Our zero days put you at risk, but we do what we like with them\\n\\n32<\\\\/span> comments<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tLog in<\\\\/strong><\\\\/a> or register<\\\\/strong><\\\\/a> to join the discussion<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<\\\\/div>\\\\n\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tGood Math <\\\\/h3>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t1 failed attempt vs 9 failed attempts would make Windows 9 Times More Secure Than Chrome OS.\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\n\\\\r\\\\nThanks for pointing that out!<\\\\/div>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t<\\\\/div>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMujibahr<\\\\/div>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t15 March, 2014 18:55<\\\\/time>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t<\\\\/div>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tYou have a bright future, in the barnyard <\\\\/h3>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t:)<\\\\/div>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tRabid Howler Monkey<\\\\/div>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t15 March, 2014 19:32<\\\\/time>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t<\\\\/div>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tShoveling <\\\\/h3>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tMujibahr<\\\\/div>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t15 March, 2014 22:40<\\\\/time>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t<\\\\/div>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t:) Still better than no-eyes... <\\\\/h3>\\\\r\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tAnd considering that it will take Microsoft 3 to 4 times longer to patch...

All the <a href=\\\"http://www.pwn2own.com/2014/03/pwn2own-2014-lineup/\\\">major Web browsers&mdash;Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (IE), and Safari&mdash;were cracked by the end of the two day competition<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<figure><img alt=\\\"HP-IE11\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"403\\\" src=\\\"http://cdn-static.zdnet.com/i/r/story/70/00/027343/hp-ie11-600x403.png?hash=MJLmMzH2ZG&upscale=1\\\" title=\\\"HP-IE11\\\" width=\\\"600\\\"><\\/img><figcaption>The HP ZDI team celebrating after cracking IE 11 on a fully-patched Windows 8.1 x64 laptop. (Credit: HP ZDI)<\\/figcaption><\\/figure>\\n<p>Before the Pwn2Own contest itself began, two of the game's sponsors, Google and ZDI, showed up their own browser cracks in an event called Pwn4Fun. First, <a href=\\\"http://www.pwn2own.com/2014/03/pwn2own-results-for-wednesday-day-one/\\\">Google cracked Apple Safari 7<\\/a> on a fully patched version of Mac OS X Maverick like an egg. At the end of the exploit, Google was running Calculator as root.<\\/p>\\n<p>ZDI, for its part, showed &quot;a multi-stage exploit, including an adaptable sandbox bypass, against Microsoft Internet Explorer, launching Scientific Calculator (running in medium integrity)&quot; in IE 11 running on an up-to-date patched Windows 8.1 x64 PC. While it wasn't as complete a crack as Google's on Safari, it was still a crushing blow. <\\/p>\\n<p>Some <a href=\\\"http://threatpost.com/charitable-prelude-to-pwn2own-not-without-its-critics/104759\\\">security experts objected to Google and ZDI showing off these exploits<\\/a>. Google security engineer Chris Evans told the security publication <a href=\\\"http://threatpost.com\\\">Threatpost<\\/a>&nbsp;that Google had shared the vulnerability with Apple beforehand. HP ZDI added that they had reported the zero day holes they used, along with six more IE security holes, to Microsoft.<\\/p>\\n<p>When the real Pwn2Own competition began, and all the browsers and associated Web browser programs, including Adobe Flash and Reader, began to fall.<\\/p>\\n<p>First, Firefox 27 went down to three different attacks on Windows 8.1 x64 PC. Then <a href=\\\"http://www.vupen.com/english/\\\">Team VUPEN<\\/a>, an elite French group of security experts, took out the latest versions of Adobe Flash and Reader, and followed this up by exploiting both other security holes in IE 11 and Firefox 27.<\\/p>\\n<p>And that was just the first day of the competition. The next day, all the browsers, including Google Chrome, got blasted again.<\\/p>\\n<p>According to HP's results coverage, the <a href=\\\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57620262-92/google-fixes-7-chrome-security-holes-just-before-cansecwest\\\">newly patched Chrome<\\/a> went down to an &quot;arbitrary read/write bug with a sandbox bypass resulting in code execution. Upon review, contest judges declared this a partial win due to one portion of the <a href=\\\"http://www.pwn2own.com/2014/03/pwn2own-results-thursday-day-two/\\\">presentation&rsquo;s collision with a vulnerability presented earlier at Pwnium.<\\/a>&quot;<\\/p>\\n<p>Chrome wasn't out of the woods yet. VUPEN cracked it with an attack that popped it open with a sandbox bypass, resulting in code execution, that worked against both the <a href=\\\"http://www.zdnet.com/blink-google-forks-webkit-7000013484/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Blink <\\/a>and WebKit Web-rendering engines.<\\/p>\\n<p>The other browsers were also in for more pain. IE 11, Firefox 27, and Safari 7 all got hammered before the competition came to an end. Only one hacker prize was left unclaimed--the &quot;Unicorn&quot; of a system-level code execution on a Windows 8.1 x64, in IE 11 x64, with an Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) bypass.<\\/p>\\n<p>At Pwn2Own's end, $850,000 had been awarded to the white-hat hackers, leaving the browser developers a lot of patch work to do. The most important result of Pwn2Own as Chaouki Bekrar, VUPEN CEO told CNET, was it showed that &quot;<a

 "{\"author\":\"John Caloyeras\",\"text\":\"Workplace wellness is a $6 billion dollar industry in the United States. Employers offer the programs to improve the health and well-being of their employees, increase their productivity, reduce their risk of costly chronic diseases, and improve control of chronic conditions. In 2012, half of all employers with at least 50 employees offered programs, and nearly half of employers without a program said they intend to introduce one.\\nThe press and trade publications strongly endorse workplace wellness programs as a good investment for employers, and even the normally skeptical academic world has joined the bandwagon. For example, a 2010 review by a Harvard economist stated that wellness programs returned three dollars in health care savings and three dollars in reduced absenteeism cost for every dollar invested.\\nBut our research tells a different story.\\nThe recently published RAND Wellness Programs Study, which included almost 600,000 employees at seven employers, showed that wellness programs are having little if any immediate effects on the amount employers spend on health care. This has been further confirmed by our new analysis of 10 years of data from a Fortune 100 employer.\\nAs is commonly the case, this employer's wellness program has two components: a lifestyle management program and a disease management program. The former focuses on employees with health risks, such as smoking and obesity, and supports them in reducing those risks and preventing the development of chronic conditions. In contrast, disease management is designed to help employees who already have a chronic disease. The goal is to help these employees take better care of themselves \\u2014 for example, by reminding them to take their prescribed medications or communicating gaps in care, such as missed lab tests, to their physicians. (Figure 1)\\nOverall, the two component programs reduced the employer's average health care costs by about $30 per member per month (PMPM). But disease management was responsible for 87% of those savings. Employees participating in the disease management program generated savings of $136 PMPM, driven in large measure by a nearly 30% reduction in hospital admissions. Furthermore, only 13% of employees participated in the disease management component, compared with 87% for the lifestyle management component. Put differently, the much higher participation in the lifestyle management component contributed only slightly to the overall savings. (Figure 2)\\nFigure 2. More employees participated in the lifestyle management program, but the bulk of health care cost savings came from the disease management program.\\nOur return-on-investment (ROI) calculations bear this out: Considering the ratio of reductions in health care costs to program costs, including the fees of the program vendors and the cost of screening employees for health risks, the overall ROI was $1.50 \\u2014 that is, a return of $1.50 for every dollar that the employer invested in the program. But the returns for the individual components differ strikingly: $3.80 for disease management but only $0.50 for lifestyle management for every dollar invested. (Figure 3)\\nThe lifestyle management program did significantly reduce absenteeism by slightly more than one hour per employee-year, but the savings generated by this benefit are not enough to make the program pay off financially.\\nOur findings challenge widely held expectations, but we believe that they are plausible, for two reasons. First, not everyone with a health risk will develop a disease; for example, not every smoker will develop lung cancer. Second, it takes a long time before a risk factor, such as obesity, leads to the development of a costly disease, such as diabetes. But employers have to cover the cost for every program participant, and they have to cover it today. Thus, preventive interventions, the core of lifestyle management, can save money, but only if the risk is high in relation to the cost of the intervention. In contrast, the health care costs avoided by successful disease management (e.g., keeping people out of hospital) can be realized in the shorter term.\\nWe recommend that employers take three lessons from these findings. First, employers need to be clear about their goals for the wellness program. The RAND Wellness Program Study has shown that lifestyle management can reduce health risks such as smoking, obesity, and lack of physical activity. Our analysis of the Fortune 100 employer's program also shows that lifestyle management can reduce absenteeism. Thus, if an employer wants to improve employee health or productivity, an evidence-based lifestyle management program can achieve this goal. But employers who are seeking a healthy ROI on their programs should target employees who already have chronic diseases.\\nSecond, given the lack of financial return from the lifestyle component, employers need to pay attention to cost. Screening all employees for health risks and offering one-to-one counseling and coaching to those with such risks is expensive, but other interventions, such as offering healthy food choices and launching educational campaigns to use the stairs, are not.\\nThird, execution really matters. The findings presented here are derived from leading employers with a strong organizational commitment to wellness and substantial experience with running programs. Learning from them how to engage employees and achieve fundamental behavior change would be prudent for employers who want comparable results.\\nThis report is part of the RAND Corporation research brief series.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://brettterpstra.com/apple-touch-icon.png\",\"text\":\"A command line tool for keeping track of what you\\u2019re doing and tracking what you\\u2019ve done.\\nWhat and why\\ndoing is a basic CLI for adding and listing \\u201cwhat was I doing\\u201d reminders in a TaskPaper-formatted text file. It allows for multiple sections/categories and flexible output formatting.\\nWhile I\\u2019m working, I have hourly reminders to record what I\\u2019m working on, and I try to remember to punch in quick notes if I\\u2019m unexpectedly called away from a project. I can do this just by typing doing now tracking down the CG bug.\\nIf there\\u2019s something I want to look at later but doesn\\u2019t need to be added to a task list or tracker, I can type doing later check out the pinboard bookmarks from macdrifter. When I get back to my computer \\u2014 or just need a refresher after a distraction \\u2014 I can type doing last to see what the last thing on my plate was. I can also type doing recent (or just doing) to get a list of the last few entries. doing today gives me everything since midnight for the current day, making it easy to see what I\\u2019ve accomplished over a sleepless night.\\nSide note: I actually use the library behind this utility as part of another script that mirrors entries in Day One that have the tag \\u201cwwid.\\u201d I can use the hourly writing reminders and enter my stuff in the quick entry popup. Someday I\\u2019ll get around to cleaning that up and putting it out there.\\nInstallation\\n$ [sudo] gem install doing\\nOnly use sudo if your environment requires it. If you\\u2019re using the system Ruby on a Mac, for example, it will likely be necessary. If gem install doing fails, then run sudo gem install doing and provide your administrator password.\\nRun doing config to open your ~/.doingrc file in the editor defined in the $EDITOR environment variable. Set up your doing_file right away (where you want entries to be stored), and cover the rest after you\\u2019ve read the docs.\\nSee the section below for troubleshooting details.\\nThe \\u201cdoing\\u201d file\\nThe file that stores all of your entries is generated the first time you add an entry with doing now (or doing later). By default the file is created in \\u201c~/what_was_i_doing.md\\u201d, but this can be modified in the config file.\\nThe format of the \\u201cdoing\\u201d file is TaskPaper-compatible. You can edit it by hand at any time (in TaskPaper or any text editor), but it uses a specific format for parsing, so be sure to maintain the dates and pipe characters.\\nNotes are anything in the list without a leading hyphen and date. They belong to the entry directly before them, and they should be indented one level beyond the parent item. When using the now and later commands on the command line, you can start the entry with a quote and hit return, then type the note and close the quote. Anything after the first line will be turned into a TaskPaper-compatible note for the task and can be displayed in templates using %note.\\nNotes can be prevented from ever appearing in output with the global option --no-notes: doing --no-notes show all.\\nConfiguration\\nA basic configuration looks like this:\\n--- doing_file: /Users/username/Dropbox/nvALT2.2/?? What was I doing.md current_section: Currently default_template: '%date: %title%note' default_date_format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' views: color: date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P' section: Currently count: 10 wrap_width: 0 template: '%boldblack%date %boldgreen| %boldwhite%title%default%note' order: desc templates: default: date_format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' template: '%date | %title%note' wrap_width: 0 today: date_format: '%_I:%M%P' template: '%date: %title%odnote' wrap_width: 0 last: date_format: '%_I:%M%P on %a' template: '%title (at %date)%odnote' wrap_width: 0 recent: date_format: '%_I:%M%P' template: '%date > %title%odnote' wrap_width: 50 :include_notes: true\\nThe config file is stored in \\u201c~/.doingrc\\u201d, and is created on the first run.\\nDoing file location\\nThe one thing you\\u2019ll probably want to adjust is the file that the notes are stored in. That\\u2019s the doing_file key:\\ndoing_file: /Users/username/Dropbox/nvALT2.2/?? What was I doing.md\\nI keep mine in my nvALT folder for quick access and syncing between machines. If desired, you can give it a .taskpaper extension to make it more recognizable to other applications. (If you do that in nvALT, make sure to add taskpaper as a recognized extension in preferences).\\n\\u201cCurrent actions\\u201d section\\nYou can rename the section that holds your current tasks. By default, this is \\u201cCurrently,\\u201d but if you have some other bright idea, feel free:\\ncurrent_section: Currently\\nDefault editors\\nThe setting editor_app only applies to Mac OS X users. It\\u2019s the default application that the command doing open will open your WWID file in. If this is blank, it will be opened by whatever the system default is, or you can use -a app_name or -b bundle_id to override.\\nIn the case of the doing now -e command, your $EDITOR environment variable will be used to complete the entry text and notes. Set it in your ~/.bash_profile or whatever is appropriate for your system:\\nexport EDITOR=\\\"mate -w\\\"\\nThe only requirements are that your editor be launchable from the command line and able to \\u201cwait.\\u201d In the case of Sublime Text and TextMate, just use -w like this: export EDITOR=\\\"subl -w\\\".\\nTemplates\\nThe config also contains templates for various command outputs. Include placeholders by placing a % before the keyword. The available tokens are:\\n%title: the \\u201cwhat was I doing\\u201d entry line\\n%date: the date based on the template\\u2019s \\u201cdate_format\\u201d setting\\n%shortdate: a custom date formatter that removes the day/month/year from the entry if they match the current day/month/year\\n%note: Any note in the entry will be included here, a newline and tabs are automatically added.\\n%odnote: The notes with a leading tab removed (outdented note)\\n%hr: a horizontal rule (-) the width of the terminal\\n%hr_under: a horizontal rule (_) the width of the terminal\\n%[color]: color can be black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan or white you can prefix \\u201cbg\\u201d to affect background colors (%bgyellow)\\nprefix \\u201cbold\\u201d and \\u201cboldbg\\u201d for strong colors (%boldgreen, %boldbgblue)\\n%interval: when used with the -t switch on the show command, it will display the time between a timestamp or @start(date) tag and the @done(date) tag, if it exists. Otherwise, it will remain empty.\\nDate formats are based on Ruby formatting.\\nMy normal template for the recent command looks like this:\\nrecent: date_format: '%_I:%M%P' template: '%date > %title%odnote' wrap_width: 88\\nAnd it outputs:\\n$ doing recent 3 4:30am > Made my `console` script smarter... Checks first argument to see if it's a file, if it is, that's the log Else, it checks the first argument for a \\\".log\\\" suffix and does a search in the user application logs with `find` for it. Otherwise, system.log. I also made an awesome Cope wrapper for it... 12:00pm > Working on `doing` again. 12:45pm > I think this thing (doing) is ready to document and distribute $\\nYou can get pretty clever and include line breaks and other formatting inside of double quotes. If you want multiline templates, just use \\u201c\\\\n\\u201d in the template line and after the next run it will be rewritten as proper YAML automatically.\\nFor example, this block:\\nrecent: date_format: '%_I:%M%P' template: \\\"\\\\n%hr\\\\n%date\\\\n > %title%odnote\\\\n%hr_under\\\" wrap_width: 100\\nwill rewrite to:\\nrecent: date_format: '%_I:%M%P' template: |2- %hr %date > %title%odnote %hr_under wrap_width: 100\\nand output my recent entries like this:\\n$ doing recent 3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 4:30am > Made my `console` script smarter... Checks first argument to see if it's a file, if it is, that's the log Else, it checks the first argument for a \\\".log\\\" suffix and does a search in the user application logs with `find` for it. Otherwise, system.log. I also made an awesome Cope wrapper for it... _______________________________________________________________________ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 12:00pm > Working on `doing` again. _______________________________________________________________________ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 12:45pm > I think this thing (doing) is ready to document and distribute _______________________________________________________________________ $\\nCustom views\\nYou can create your own \\u201cviews\\u201d in the ~/.doingrc file and view them with doing view view_name. Just add a section like this:\\nviews: old: section: Old count: 5 wrap_width: 0 date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P' template: '%date | %title%note' order: asc tags: done finished cancelled tags_bool: ANY\\nYou can add additional custom views, just nest them under the \\u201cviews\\u201d key (indented two spaces from the edge). Multiple views would look like this:\\nviews: later: section: Later count: 5 wrap_width: 60 date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P' template: '%date | %title%note' old: section: Old count: 5 wrap_width: 0 date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P' template: '%date | %title%note'\\nThe \\u201csection\\u201d key is the default section to pull entries from. Count and section can be overridden at runtime with the -c and -s flags. Setting section to All will combine all sections in the output.\\nYou can add new sections with doing add_section section_name. You can also create them on the fly by using the -s section_name flag when running doing now. For example, doing now -s Misc just a random side note would create the \\u201cjust a random side note\\u201d entry in a new section called \\u201cMisc,\\u201d if Misc didn\\u2019t already exist.\\nThe tags and tags_bool keys allow you to specify tags that the view is filtered by. You can list multiple tags separated by spaces, and then use tags_bool to specify \\u201cALL,\\u201d \\u201cANY,\\u201d or \\u201cNONE\\u201d to determine how it handles the multiple tags.\\nThe order key defines the sort order of the output. This is applied after the tasks are retrieved and cut off at the maximum number specified in count.\\nRegarding colors, you can use them to create very nice displays if you\\u2019re outputting to a color terminal. Example:\\ncolor: date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P' section: Currently count: 10 wrap_width: 0 template: '%boldblack%date %boldgreen| %boldwhite%title%default%note'\\nOutputs:\\nUsage:\\ndoing [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]\\nGlobal options:\\n--[no-]notes - Output notes if included in the template (default: enabled) --version - Display the program version --help - Show help message and usage summary\\nCommands:\\nhelp - Shows a list of commands and global options help [command] - Shows help for any command (`doing help now`)\\nAdding entries:\\nnow - Add an entry later - Add an item to the Later section done - Add a completed item with @done(date). No argument finishes last entry.\\nThe doing now command can accept -s section_name to send the new entry straight to a non-default section.\\ndoing done is used to add an entry that you\\u2019ve already completed. Like now, you can specify a section with -s section_name. You can also skip straight to Archive with -a.\\nYou can also backdate entries using natural language with --back 15m or --back \\\"3/15 3pm\\\". That will modify the timestamp of the entry. When used with doing done, this allows time intervals to be accurately counted when entering items after the fact.\\nAll of these commands accept a -e argument. This opens your command line editor as defined in the environment variable $EDITOR. Add your entry, save the temp file and close it, and the new entry will be added. Anything after the first line is included as a note on the entry.\\nModifying entries:\\nfinish - Mark last X entries as @done tag - Tag last entry\\ndoing finish by itself is the same as doing done by itself. It adds @done(timestamp) to the last entry. It also accepts a numeric argument to complete X number of tasks back in history. Add -a to also archive the affected entries.\\ntag adds one or more tags to the last entry, or specify a count with -c X. Tags are specified as basic arguments, separated by spaces. For example:\\ndoing tag -c 3 client cancelled\\n\\u2026 will mark the last three entries as \\u201c@client @cancelled.\\u201d Add -r as a switch to remove the listed tags instead.\\nDisplaying entries:\\nshow - List all entries recent - List recent entries today - List entries from today last - Show the last entry\\ndoing show on its own will list all entries in the \\u201cCurrently\\u201d section. Add a section name as an argument to display that section instead. Use \\u201call\\u201d to display all entries from all sections.\\nYou can filter the show command by tags. Simply list them after the section name (or \\u201call\\u201d). The boolean defaults to \\u201cANY,\\u201d meaning any entry that contains any of the listed tags will be shown. You can use -b ALL or -b NONE to change the filtering behavior: doing show all done cancelled -b NONE will show all tasks from all sections that do not have either \\u201c@done\\u201d or \\u201c@cancelled\\u201d tags.\\nUse -c X to limit the displayed results. Combine it with -a newest or -a oldest to choose which chronological end it trims from. You can also set the sort order of the output with -s asc or -s desc.\\nThe show command can also show the time spent on a task if it has a @done(date) tag with the -t option. This requires that you include a %interval token in template -> default in the config. You can also include @start(date) tags, which override the timestamp when calculating the intervals.\\nIf you have a use for it, you can use --csv on the show or view commands to output the results as a comma-separated CSV to STDOUT.

It allows for multiple sections/categories and flexible output formatting.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>While I&rsquo;m working, I have hourly reminders to record what I&rsquo;m working on, and I try to remember to punch in quick notes if I&rsquo;m unexpectedly called away from a project. I can do this just by typing <code>doing now tracking down the CG bug<\\/code>. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>If there&rsquo;s something I want to look at later but doesn&rsquo;t need to be added to a task list or tracker, I can type <code>doing later check out the pinboard bookmarks from macdrifter<\\/code>. When I get back to my computer &mdash; or just need a refresher after a distraction &mdash; I can type <code>doing last<\\/code> to see what the last thing on my plate was. I can also type <code>doing recent<\\/code> (or just <code>doing<\\/code>) to get a list of the last few entries. <code>doing today<\\/code> gives me everything since midnight for the current day, making it easy to see what I&rsquo;ve accomplished over a sleepless night.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><em>Side note:<\\/em> I actually use the library behind this utility as part of another script that mirrors entries in <a href=\\\"http://dayoneapp.com/\\\">Day One<\\/a> that have the tag &ldquo;wwid.&rdquo; I can use the hourly writing reminders and enter my stuff in the quick entry popup.

They belong to the entry directly before them, and they should be indented one level beyond the parent item. When using the <code>now<\\/code> and <code>later<\\/code> commands on the command line, you can start the entry with a quote and hit return, then type the note and close the quote. Anything after the first line will be turned into a TaskPaper-compatible note for the task and can be displayed in templates using <code>%note<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Notes can be prevented from ever appearing in output with the global option <code>--no-notes<\\/code>: <code>doing --no-notes show all<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"configuration\\\">Configuration<\\/h2>\\n\\n<p>A basic configuration looks like this:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>---\\ndoing_file: /Users/username/Dropbox/nvALT2.2/??

Otherwise, it will remain empty.<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n\\n<p>Date formats are based on Ruby  formatting.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>My normal template for the <code>recent<\\/code> command looks like this:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>recent:\\n  date_format: '%_I:%M%P'\\n  template: '%date &gt; %title%odnote'\\n  wrap_width: 88\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>And it outputs:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>$ doing recent 3\\n 4:30am &gt; Made my `console` script smarter...\\n    Checks first argument to see if it's a file, if it is, that's the log\\n\\n    Else, it checks the first argument for a \\\".log\\\" suffix and does a search in the user\\n    application logs with `find` for it.\\n\\n    Otherwise, system.log.\\n\\n    I also made an awesome Cope wrapper for it...\\n12:00pm &gt; Working on `doing` again.\\n12:45pm &gt; I think this thing (doing) is ready to document and distribute\\n$ \\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>You can get pretty clever and include line breaks and other formatting inside of double quotes. If you want multiline templates, just use &ldquo;\\\\n&rdquo; in the template line and after the next run it will be rewritten as proper YAML automatically.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>For example, this block:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>recent:\\n  date_format: '%_I:%M%P'\\n  template: \\\"\\\\n%hr\\\\n%date\\\\n &gt; %title%odnote\\\\n%hr_under\\\"\\n  wrap_width: 100\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>will rewrite to:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>recent:\\n  date_format: '%_I:%M%P'\\n  template: |2-\\n\\n    %hr\\n    %date\\n     &gt; %title%odnote\\n    %hr_under\\n  wrap_width: 100\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>and output my recent entries like this:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>$ doing recent 3\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n 4:30am\\n &gt; Made my `console` script smarter...\\n    Checks first argument to see if it's a file, if it is, that's the log\\n\\n    Else, it checks the first argument for a \\\".log\\\" suffix and does a search in the user application\\n    logs with `find` for it.\\n\\n    Otherwise, system.log.\\n\\n    I also made an awesome Cope wrapper for it...\\n_______________________________________________________________________\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n12:00pm\\n &gt; Working on `doing` again.\\n_______________________________________________________________________\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n12:45pm\\n &gt; I think this thing (doing) is ready to document and distribute\\n_______________________________________________________________________\\n\\n$ \\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"custom-views\\\">Custom views<\\/h3>\\n\\n<p>You can create your own &ldquo;views&rdquo; in the <code>~/.doingrc<\\/code> file and view them with <code>doing view view_name<\\/code>. Just add a section like this:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>views:\\n  old:\\n    section: Old\\n    count: 5\\n    wrap_width: 0\\n    date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P'\\n    template: '%date | %title%note'\\n    order: asc\\n    tags: done finished cancelled\\n    tags_bool: ANY\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>You can add additional custom views, just nest them under the &ldquo;views&rdquo; key (indented two spaces from the edge). Multiple views would look like this:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>views:\\n  later:\\n    section: Later\\n    count: 5\\n    wrap_width: 60\\n    date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P'\\n    template: '%date | %title%note'\\n  old:\\n    section: Old\\n    count: 5\\n    wrap_width: 0\\n    date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P'\\n    template: '%date | %title%note' \\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>The &ldquo;section&rdquo; key is the default section to pull entries from. Count and section can be overridden at runtime with the <code>-c<\\/code> and <code>-s<\\/code> flags. Setting <code>section<\\/code> to All will combine all sections in the output.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>You can add new sections with <code>doing add_section section_name<\\/code>. You can also create them on the fly by using the <code>-s section_name<\\/code> flag when running <code>doing now<\\/code>. For example, <code>doing now -s Misc just a random side note<\\/code> would create the &ldquo;just a random side note&rdquo; entry in a new section called &ldquo;Misc,&rdquo; if Misc didn&rsquo;t already exist.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The <code>tags<\\/code> and <code>tags_bool<\\/code> keys allow you to specify tags that the view is filtered by. You can list multiple tags separated by spaces, and then use <code>tags_bool<\\/code> to specify &ldquo;ALL,&rdquo; &ldquo;ANY,&rdquo; or &ldquo;NONE&rdquo; to determine how it handles the multiple tags.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The <code>order<\\/code> key defines the sort order of the output. This is applied <em>after<\\/em> the tasks are retrieved and cut off at the maximum number specified in <code>count<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Regarding colors, you can use them to create very nice displays if you&rsquo;re outputting to a color terminal. Example:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>color:\\n  date_format: '%F %_I:%M%P'\\n  section: Currently\\n  count: 10\\n  wrap_width: 0\\n  template: '%boldblack%date %boldgreen| %boldwhite%title%default%note'\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>Outputs: <\\/p>\\n\\n<p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://ckyp.us/XKpj+\\\"><\\/img><\\/p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"usage\\\">Usage:<\\/h2>\\n\\n<pre><code>doing [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"global-options\\\">Global options:<\\/h3>\\n\\n<pre><code>--[no-]notes        - Output notes if included in the template (default: enabled)\\n--version           - Display the program version\\n--help              - Show help message and usage summary\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"commands\\\">Commands:<\\/h3>\\n\\n<pre><code>help           - Shows a list of commands and global options\\nhelp [command] - Shows help for any command (`doing help now`)\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<h4 id=\\\"adding-entries\\\">Adding entries:<\\/h4>\\n\\n<pre><code>now      - Add an entry\\nlater    - Add an item to the Later section\\ndone     - Add a completed item with @done(date). No argument finishes last entry.\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>The <code>doing now<\\/code> command can accept <code>-s section_name<\\/code> to send the new entry straight to a non-default section. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p><code>doing done<\\/code> is used to add an entry that you&rsquo;ve already completed. Like <code>now<\\/code>, you can specify a section with <code>-s section_name<\\/code>. You can also skip straight to Archive with <code>-a<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>You can also backdate entries using natural language with <code>--back 15m<\\/code> or <code>--back &quot;3/15 3pm&quot;<\\/code>. That will modify the timestamp of the entry. When used with <code>doing done<\\/code>, this allows time intervals to be accurately counted when entering items after the fact.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>All of these commands accept a <code>-e<\\/code> argument. This opens your command line editor as defined in the environment variable <code>$EDITOR<\\/code>. Add your entry, save the temp file and close it, and the new entry will be added. Anything after the first line is included as a note on the entry.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h4 id=\\\"modifying-entries\\\">Modifying entries:<\\/h4>\\n\\n<pre><code>finish      - Mark last X entries as @done\\ntag         - Tag last entry\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p><code>doing finish<\\/code> by itself is the same as <code>doing done<\\/code> by itself. It adds <code>@done(timestamp)<\\/code> to the last entry. It also accepts a numeric argument to complete X number of tasks back in history. Add <code>-a<\\/code> to also archive the affected entries.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p><code>tag<\\/code> adds one or more tags to the last entry, or specify a count with <code>-c X<\\/code>. Tags are specified as basic arguments, separated by spaces. For example:<\\/p>\\n\\n<pre><code>doing tag -c 3 client cancelled\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p>&hellip; will mark the last three entries as &ldquo;@client @cancelled.&rdquo; Add <code>-r<\\/code> as a switch to remove the listed tags instead.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h4 id=\\\"displaying-entries\\\">Displaying entries:<\\/h4>\\n\\n<pre><code>show     - List all entries\\nrecent   - List recent entries\\ntoday    - List entries from today\\nlast     - Show the last entry\\n<\\/code><\\/pre>\\n\\n<p><code>doing show<\\/code> on its own will list all entries in the &ldquo;Currently&rdquo; section. Add a section name as an argument to display that section instead. Use &ldquo;all&rdquo; to display all entries from all sections.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>You can filter the <code>show<\\/code> command by tags. Simply list them after the section name (or &ldquo;all&rdquo;). The boolean defaults to &ldquo;ANY,&rdquo; meaning any entry that contains any of the listed tags will be shown. You can use <code>-b ALL<\\/code> or <code>-b NONE<\\/code> to change the filtering behavior: <code>doing show all done cancelled -b NONE<\\/code> will show all tasks from all sections that do not have either &ldquo;@done&rdquo; or &ldquo;@cancelled&rdquo; tags.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Use <code>-c X<\\/code> to limit the displayed results. Combine it with <code>-a newest<\\/code> or <code>-a oldest<\\/code> to choose which chronological end it trims from. You can also set the sort order of the output with <code>-s asc<\\/code> or <code>-s desc<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The <code>show<\\/code> command can also show the time spent on a task if it has a <code>@done(date)<\\/code> tag with the <code>-t<\\/code> option. This requires that you include a <code>%interval<\\/code> token in template -&gt; default in the config. You can also include <code>@start(date)<\\/code> tags, which override the timestamp when calculating the intervals.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>If you have a use for it, you can use <code>--csv<\\/code> on the show or view commands to output the results as a comma-separated CSV to STDOUT.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/avatar_eba902c1470e_128.png\",\"text\":\"The effect I\\u2019ll be describing is our light-emitting logo whose white color chromatically disperses (its composite red, green, and blue wavelengths separate), while sitting above a partially-reflective surface:\\nIf you have a WebGL-enabled, non-mobile browser, you can view the effect live here.\\nLike many computationally-expensive effects that must be made real-time, this one accomplished primarily by cheating. Rather than constructing a physically-accurate scene where we simulate the bouncing light rays of a blurred reflection, we will instead create a much simpler scene composed of a few effects, the output of which looks close enough to the real thing.\\nThis tutorial assumes some basic knowledge of javascript and WebGL.\\nFirst things first\\nWe need to know if the client\\u2019s browser can support WebGL before we can render anything. I use a helper function, refactored and altered from http://get.webgl.org/, though one could just as easily use Modernizr to feature-detect WebGL:\\nfunction getWebGL(canvas) { var experimental = false; var gl = null; try { gl = canvas[0].getContext(\\\"webgl\\\"); } catch (x) { gl = null; } if (gl == null) { try { gl = canvas[0].getContext(\\\"experimental-webgl\\\"); experimental = true; } catch (x) { gl = null; } } return gl; }\\nThis takes a jQuery canvas element which exists on the page as:\\n<canvas id=\\\"logo-canvas\\\" width=\\\"256\\\"; height=\\\"256\\\"><\\/canvas>\\nAnd is fetched from the page with:\\nvar canvas = $(\\\"#logo-canvas\\\");\\nIf the client supports WebGL, getWebGL() will return an OpenGL rendering context, otherwise null. This can then be used to determine if we should continue to create a WebGL visualization, or gracefully degrade to a fallback logo.\\nRefresher on shaders\\nShaders compose the primary rendering processes in OpenGL. They come in two flavors: vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Both are required* to create a shader program \\u2014 a GPU executable that takes vertices, textures, and other data as input, passes it through its vertex shader and then fragment shader, to produce an image as its output.\\nThe vertex shader and fragment shader in a shader program are linked together in a special way such that the output of the vertex shader flows into the fragment shader as interpolated values:\\nFor our uses, we will not be sending rendering-specific vertex data to our shader programs (like 3d models). The bulk of our rendering work will live in the fragment shader half of the shader programs, so we will use a single vertex shader for all of our shader programs. This shader will serve simply to provide us with accurate texture coordinates to each invocation of the fragment shaders:\\n/* * a single vertex data attribute is sent to us from our javascript code: * the vertex's xy position */ attribute vec2 pos; /* * the texture coordinate sent to our shader program. because `texcoord` will * be generated by the location of the vertex itself, our fragment shader will * be aware of it's own location in texture coordinate space */ varying mediump vec2 texcoord; void main() { gl_Position = vec4(pos, 0, 1); /* * the vertices we're sending in as `pos` are in clip space ([-1, 1], with * the center of the viewport as 0,0), so it's an easy conversion to * texture space [0.0, 1.0] */ texcoord = (pos + vec2(1)) / vec2(2.0); }\\nThe vertex data fed to every shader program is:\\ngl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array([ -1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ]), gl.STATIC_DRAW);\\nThe idea here is we send 4, 2-component vertices into the vertex shader \\u2014 one for each xy corner of a quadrilateral in clip space. This vertex shader then turns the position of each vertex into its corresponding texture coordinate (texcoord), which is then fed to the fragment shader. The result is that in the fragment shader, we\\u2019ll know the exact texture coordinate of the pixel we\\u2019re operating on.\\nThe rendering pipeline\\nOur pipeline relies heavily on a mechanism known as render-to-texture. This is a process where the output of one shader program is stored as a temporary image (a texture) to be fed as the input to another shader program. It is analogous to a function which returns an array as the input to another function. These rendering processes can be chained together to produce a post-processing pipeline. The end of the chain is usually displayed to the user. Many modern games use pipelines like this to create advanced effects, like depth of field, SSAO, and cartoon shading.\\nIn Python pseudo-code, here is what we\\u2019re going to do at a very high level:\\nlogo_tex = open_texture(\\\"logo.png\\\") separated_logo_tex = chromatic_separation_shader(logo_tex) blurred_logo_tex = variable_blur_shader(separated_logo_tex) display_on_cavas(blurred_logo_text)\\nThe effect\\nTo first know how the effect should look, we can use Blender to produce how the effect would look with physically-accurate reflections. This means:\\nDesign the pre-color-separated logo\\nPlace it above a reflective surface and cause it to emit light\\nPosition the camera to capture the logo and reflective surface\\nSetting up the Blender scene and materials is outside of the scope of this post, but the end result is a simple scene:\\nWhen rendered, the scene produces the following image, which is used as both a fallback logo (in the case of WebGL being unavailable), and as a reference image when creating the shaders. Since this image is physically accurate, we must make our WebGL shaders come as close as possible to replicating it:\\nSeparating the color\\nNow that we know what the end result should look like, we can start creating it. We start by performing a chromatic dispersion, or color separation. Essentially, the red, green, and blue color channels of a white logo need to be separated by given amount, specified by a value that we pass in.\\nAt first glance, this seems like a simple operation: for each pixel in the input image, use the fragment shader to take its red, green, and blue channels, and write them to other pixel locations, according to how you want the channels separated.\\nHowever\\u2026\\nOne major gotcha in shader development is thinking of effects as \\u201cscatter\\u201d operations, or in other words, operations where a pixel is processed, and the result is written to other pixel locations. Blurs are a typical example of a conceptually \\u201cscattering\\u201d operation: each pixel is distributed to other pixels over a radial distance according to the amount of the blur.\\nUnfortunately, modern GPU hardware cannot perform scatter operations. For each pixel a fragment shader operates on, the shader must return the new value of that one pixel \\u2014 it can\\u2019t write to other pixel positions. This limitation requires that we think of scatter operations instead as \\u201cgather\\u201d operations. Instead of spreading our pixel onto new pixels, we will say that our new pixel\\u2019s value will be the result of spreading the surrounding pixels onto it. The end result of a gather is the same as a scatter, so this is what we will do for chromatic dispersion, and later for our blurs.\\nFig. 1 shows the color separation as a scatter operation. The highlighted white pixel\\u2019s color channels are scattered by -2 pixels (negative, to the left). This means the white pixel must add its blue value to the pixel at x-2, its green value to the pixel at x-4, and it\\u2019s red value to the pixel at x-6.\\nFig. 2 shows the color separation as a gather operation. The yellow pixel gathered its color channels at +2 pixels spacing (positive, to the right). This means it gathered its red from the pixel at x+6, its green from the pixel at x+4, and it\\u2019s blue from the pixel at x+2. Because green and red had values of 1.0, while blue had a value of 0.0, the resulting color is yellow.\\nFig. 3 shows the end result of applying the gather operation to every pixel in the input image.\\nNow that we understand how a scatter-as-gather operation works, we will use it in our chromatic dispersion fragment shader below:\\n/* * chromatic dispersion fragment shader */ precision mediump float; /* * input from our vertex shader. each pixel that we process with our fragment * shader will know its own x,y location */ varying vec2 texcoord; /* * our logo texture */ uniform sampler2D tex; /* * the size of our logo texture. basic metadata about our texture is unavailble * in a shader unless we pass it in explicitly, like this */ uniform vec2 tex_size; /* * the amount, in pixels, that each color channel should separate from eachother */ uniform float spacing; void main() { /* * here we compute, in texture units, how far `spacing`, in pixels, * actually is. dividing spacing by the width of our logo texture puts us * in the range [0.0, 1.0] */ float separation = spacing / tex_size.x; /* * because our logo texture is shorter than it is wide, and yet both x * and y coordinate systems range from [0.0, 1.0], we compute the ratio so * we know how much to adjust the y-coordinate lookup */ float ratio = tex_size.x / tex_size.y; float offset = -2.0 * tex_size.y / tex_size.x; /* * this is where we're going to sample the logo texture from. notice that * we're adjusting the y-axis. this is because the texture that we're * rendering to is twice as tall as our logo texture */ vec2 sample_coord = vec2(texcoord.x, texcoord.y * ratio + offset); /* * perform our individual color channel lookups, using separation and * a direction multiplier */ float red_sample = texture2D(tex, vec2(sample_coord.x + separation * -1.0, sample_coord.y)).r; float green_sample = texture2D(tex, vec2(sample_coord.x + separation * 0.0, sample_coord.y)).g; float blue_sample = texture2D(tex, vec2(sample_coord.x + separation * 1.0, sample_coord.y)).b; /* * now that we have each color that this pixel should be composed of, we * add them together setting this pixel's color components to the values * we retrieved */ gl_FragColor = vec4(red_sample, green_sample, blue_sample, 1.0); }\\nCreating the blurred reflection\\nThe blur happens in two passes:\\nWe blur vertically\\nWe blur horizontally\\nThe reason for two passes instead of one is that two passes results in a reduction in the number of required texture samples. Two passes gives us O(2n) time complexity for each pixel, while one pass is O(n^2) complexity. This allows us to do larger blurs for much cheaper, since performing texture lookups is expensive, and we\\u2019re doing fewer of them.\\nThe first pass will be vertical. This means that for each pixel we\\u2019re operating on, we will only look up and down to gather the blur samples. The second pass will be horizontal, which means that we\\u2019ll only look left and right to gather the blur samples.\\nThe blur itself is performed by sampling a texture at specific locations along a gaussian curve, then weighting the sample by an amount according to its position on the curve. So starting from a central pixel (the pixel being gathered), and walking outwards to the left and to the right (in the case of a horizontal blur), sampling your texture as you go, you are accumulating these samples into the final pixel value:\\nThe thickness of the arrows represents the weight of that sample, according to its location on the gaussian curve.\\nOne thing to keep in mind is that that the sum of the weights should always equal 1.0, otherwise the resulting blurred image will be brighter (if the sum is > 1.0) or darker (if the sum is < 1.0) than the original input image.\\nBelow, we\\u2019ve translated this logic into the vertical blur shader. It has some additional logic to mirror the logo across the x-axis at a virtual \\u201cground\\u201d line, so that instead of the blur happening in-place, the blurred pixels are drawn below this ground line and flipped vertically.\\nprecision mediump float; varying mediump vec2 texcoord; uniform sampler2D tex; uniform vec2 pixel_size; /* * ground represents the location of the mirroring line, in texture space * (so from 0.0 to 1.0) */ uniform float ground; /* * this is the height of the reflection in texture space. we use this to * determine how much we should be blurring, since we want the reflection to * blur more, the further away it is */ uniform float ref_height; /* * these arrays represent 16 fixed points along a gaussian curve, but picked * in such a way as to minimize the number of texture lookup required by * relying on the GPU hardware's bilinear interpolation */ uniform float weights[16]; uniform float offsets[16]; uniform vec2 sample_axis; /* * a helper function that gives us the texture location by only passing in the */ vec2 sample_coord(float offset) { return sample_axis * offset * pixel_size; } void main() { const float logo_height = 0.12; vec2 adj_texcoord = texcoord; adj_texcoord.y = 1.0 - adj_texcoord.y + ground - logo_height; /* * `gradient` and `inv_gradient` will serve as an amount by which to blur * our current texel. the idea here is that we're blurring more, the * further away from the \\\"ground\\\" we are */ float gradient = mix(0.0, 1.0, ((texcoord.y - (ground - ref_height + logo_height)) / ref_height)); float inv_gradient = max(1.0 - pow(gradient, 2.0), 0.0); vec4 color; // center texel color = texture2D(tex, adj_texcoord) * weights[0]; /* * sample the textures */ int j=1; for (int i=1; i<16; i++) { color += texture2D(tex, adj_texcoord + sample_coord(offsets[i] + float(j)) * inv_gradient) * weights[i]; color += texture2D(tex, adj_texcoord - sample_coord(offsets[i] + float(j)) * inv_gradient) * weights[i]; j += 2; } gl_FragColor += color; gl_FragColor.a = 1.0; }\\nThe second blur pass, the horizontal blur pass, is much the same as the first blur pass, except no mirroring is performed.\\nConnecting the different stages\\nTo tie it all together, we need to set up the rendering pipeline we described earlier.\\nLet\\u2019s take a look at our javascript render function. Each pass is performed by first binding a , defining or attaching the various shader inputs, then executing the shader program by calling drawScreen():\\nfunction render() { /* * pass 1, color separation. the width of the separation is controlled * by logoAnimator.value */ gl.bindFramebuffer(gl.FRAMEBUFFER, colorSeparationFBO); gl.useProgram(colorSepProgram); gl.activeTexture(gl.TEXTURE0 + 0); gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, logo); gl.uniform1i(gl.getUniformLocation(colorSepProgram, \\\"tex\\\"), 0); gl.uniform2fv(gl.getUniformLocation(colorSepProgram, \\\"tex_size\\\"), [1024.0, 512.0]); gl.uniform1f(gl.getUniformLocation(colorSepProgram, \\\"spacing\\\"), -logoAnimator.value); drawScreen(); /* * pass 2, vertical blur, using colorSeparationFBO as our input */ gl.bindFramebuffer(gl.FRAMEBUFFER, blurStage1FBO); gl.useProgram(gaussianBlurProgram); gl.activeTexture(gl.TEXTURE0 + 0); gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, colorSeparationFBO.colorAttachment); gl.uniform1i(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurProgram, \\\"tex\\\"), 0); gl.uniform1f(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurProgram, \\\"ground\\\"), groundLocation); gl.uniform1f(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurProgram, \\\"ref_height\\\"), reflectionHeight); gl.uniform2fv(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurProgram, \\\"pixel_size\\\"), [1.0/CANVAS_SIZE[0], 1.0/CANVAS_SIZE[1]]); gl.uniform1fv(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurProgram, \\\"weights\\\"), [ 0.0335575010461,0.0665417731923,0.0642977802085,0.0604475739708, 0.055289549608,0.0492026511107,0.0426005515661,0.0358858466478, 0.0294111777665,0.0234521609327,0.0181942655819,0.0137330623107, 0.0100851283165,0.00720570737276,0.00500902207902,0.00186499881285 ]); gl.uniform1fv(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurProgram, \\\"offsets\\\"), [ 0.0,0.497422733884,0.493986615759,0.490551065619,0.487116407772, 0.483682966191,0.480251064389,0.476821025299,0.473393171151, 0.469967823353,0.466545302369,0.463125927601,0.459710017271, 0.456297888301,0.4528898562,0.0 ]); gl.uniform2fv(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurProgram, \\\"sample_axis\\\"), [0, 1]); drawScreen(); /* * pass 3, horizontal blur, using blurStage1FBO as our input. notice * that we're UNBINDING the current framebuffer, because the output of * this stage is not being saved to a texture, but rather being dumped * to the GL context on the screen. */ gl.bindFramebuffer(gl.FRAMEBUFFER, null); gl.useProgram(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram); gl.activeTexture(gl.TEXTURE0 + 0); gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, blurStage1FBO.colorAttachment); gl.uniform1i(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram, \\\"tex\\\"), 0); gl.activeTexture(gl.TEXTURE0 + 1); gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, colorSeparationFBO.colorAttachment); gl.uniform1i(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram, \\\"logo\\\"), 1); gl.uniform1f(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram, \\\"ground\\\"), groundLocation); gl.uniform1f(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram, \\\"ref_height\\\"), reflectionHeight); gl.uniform1f(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram, \\\"reflection_dim\\\"), reflectionDim); gl.uniform2fv(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram, \\\"pixel_size\\\"), [1.0/CANVAS_SIZE[0], 1.0/CANVAS_SIZE[1]]); gl.uniform1fv(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram, \\\"weights\\\"), [ 0.0335575010461,0.0665417731923,0.0642977802085,0.0604475739708, 0.055289549608,0.0492026511107,0.0426005515661,0.0358858466478, 0.0294111777665,0.0234521609327,0.0181942655819,0.0137330623107, 0.0100851283165,0.00720570737276,0.00500902207902,0.00186499881285 ]); gl.uniform1fv(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram, \\\"offsets\\\"), [ 0.0,0.497422733884,0.493986615759,0.490551065619,0.487116407772, 0.483682966191,0.480251064389,0.476821025299,0.473393171151, 0.469967823353,0.466545302369,0.463125927601,0.459710017271, 0.456297888301,0.4528898562,0.0 ]); gl.uniform2fv(gl.getUniformLocation(gaussianBlurHorizontalProgram, \\\"sample_axis\\\"), [1, 0]); drawScreen(); }\\nIn this way, 3 moderlately-complicated effects are performed as a pipelined operation.\\nThat\\u2019s it!

For each pixel\\na fragment shader operates on, the shader must return the new value of that one pixel\\n&mdash; it <em>can&rsquo;t<\\/em> write to other pixel positions.\\nThis limitation requires that we think of scatter operations instead as &ldquo;gather&rdquo;\\noperations.\\nInstead of spreading our pixel onto new pixels, we will say that our new pixel&rsquo;s\\nvalue will be the result of spreading the surrounding pixels onto it.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://www.newyorker.com/favicon.ico\",\"author\":\"Amy Merrick\",\"text\":\"When the Woodville Mall opened, in 1969, in Northwood, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, its developers bragged about the mall\\u2019s million square feet of enclosed space; its anchor tenants, which included Sears and J. C. Penney; and its air-conditioning\\u2014seventy-two degrees, year-round! Two years later, the Toledo Blade published a front-page article about the photo-takers and people-watchers who gathered around the mall\\u2019s marble fountain, \\u201cthat gushing monument to big spending and the shopping spree.\\u201d The story quoted an anonymous businessman: \\u201cThe water has a great calming effect on a person, especially when you\\u2019ve been badgered all morning.\\u201d\\nThis week, Woodville is being torn down. So are countless other malls across the U.S.\\u2014so many that there\\u2019s a Web site devoted to \\u201cdead malls\\u201d that are out of commission. In some cases, the buildings have been converted into community colleges, corporate headquarters, or churches. Others, like the Woodville Mall, have become so damaged by water, mold, and asbestos that city officials are glad to demolish them. In January, Rick Caruso, the C.E.O. of Caruso Affiliated, one of the largest privately held American real-estate companies, stood on a stage at the Javits Center, in New York, and forecast the demise of the traditional mall. \\u201cWithin ten to fifteen years, the typical U.S. mall, unless it is completely reinvented, will be a historical anachronism\\u2014a sixty-year aberration that no longer meets the public\\u2019s needs, the retailers\\u2019 needs, or the community\\u2019s needs,\\u201d he told his audience, which had gathered for the National Retail Federation\\u2019s annual convention.\\nPart of what\\u2019s hurting the mall, obviously, is that, increasingly, people are shopping online. Internet sales reached six per cent of total retail spending in the fourth quarter of 2013, nearly doubling their share from 2006. Some retailers, understandably, are responding by focussing more on the online end of the retail business. Gap, which became synonymous with the American mall, is no longer counting on malls for growth. \\u201cCulturally, the business pivoted towards digital,\\u201d Glenn Murphy, the C.E.O., said, describing the past year. \\u201cMall traffic, for a number of years, has been slowing down. Whether it continues to decline somewhat over time, I think that\\u2019s realistic to assume.\\u201d Gap customers now can order clothes online and pick them up in a store. When it opens new stores this year, Gap will focus on Asia; earlier this month, the company launched its Old Navy brand in China.\\nIt\\u2019s not hard to imagine the future that Caruso described, in which malls are obsolete: the case for Amazon is pretty strong when the alternative is to crawl through gridlock to a mall, unwittingly park in the space farthest from the store you plan to visit, cringe as toddlers\\u2019 shrieks reverberate off the tile floors, and dodge salesmen hawking knockoff perfumes and hundred-dollar curling irons. But Caruso offers an interesting alternative scenario: what if malls reinvented themselves? As any cubicle dweller knows, people like natural light and fresh air and, when deprived of them, feel oppressed. So are people alienated by those older malls, with their raw concrete, brutalist architecture and fretful, defensive air? Developers have a shorthand for this style: the \\u201cclassic graybox.\\u201d In his talk, Caruso flashed grim photos of their fa\u00e7ades. He lingered on a picture of a deserted food court; you could practically smell the stale grease. \\u201cDoes this look like the future to you?\\u201d he asked. On Monday, Sbarro, which represents one of the four food groups of mall cuisine, along with Jamba Juice, Panda Express, and Cinnabon, filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years. Court papers cited an \\u201cunprecedented decline in mall traffic,\\u201d meaning fewer hungry shoppers settling for foldable pizza slices.\\nIt\\u2019s worth noting that Caruso has a good reason to pitch the reinvention of malls to developers: outdoor malls are his company\\u2019s focus. After his speech, he told me, an executive from one of the largest indoor-mall real-estate companies called to ask if his company could learn more about outdoor malls. But competitors aren\\u2019t always so welcoming. In 2011, Caruso\\u2019s company cancelled plans for an outdoor mall in the parking lot of the Santa Anita Park racetrack after a legal challenge from Westfield, which owned a nearby indoor mall, and a bankruptcy filing by Caruso\\u2019s business partner.\\nReinventing malls\\u2014and the stores that they house\\u2014might not be as straightforward as it seems. For all his shortcomings, Ron Johnson, the much criticized former C.E.O. of J. C. Penney, understood the warnings. He re\u00ebnvisioned J. C. Penney stores, with their enormous\\u2014and enormously dated\\u2014open spaces, as places for people not only to shop but to hang out, drink coffee, and surf the Internet. His remodelling blueprints called for a \\u201cstreet\\u201d inside each store leading to a spacious \\u201csquare\\u201d that could host yoga classes and other events. But there were two problems with the plan: sales were falling too quickly to support the tremendous renovation costs, and, even if J. C. Penney could have covered the expenses, the stores would have remained stuck in old-fashioned malls. In that sense, Johnson\\u2019s previous job running Apple\\u2019s retail stores was far simpler\\u2014just plunk down a gleaming glass cube on the most profitable shopping streets around the world. Now under new leadership, J. C. Penney has completed only a fraction of the remodelling plans.\\nAmong developers, there\\u2019s a tacit acknowledgment that the oldest, sickest malls, the kind that you associate with defunct chains like Waldenbooks and Tower Records, may be left to die. Meanwhile, there\\u2019s money to be made from rich people in the U. S. and from everyone in Asia, where malls are not yet pass\u00e9. In October, Taubman Centers Inc. plans to open a mall anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue in Sarasota, Florida. Though designed as an indoor mall, it will have plenty of brightly lit storefronts that shoppers can enter from the parking lot, darting in and out like fish sampling bait.\\nBut, like Gap, Taubman sees its future in the two malls that it\\u2019s developing in China and in a third mall, in South Korea. \\u201cThere is limited growth in the United States for new supply,\\u201d Robert Taubman, the C.E.O., said recently. \\u201cWe think that, in the long term, China, Asia, represents an opportunity for us to continue to grow this company.\\u201d Simon Property Group, another big developer, said in December that it will spin off into a separate company its strip centers and smaller enclosed malls in places like Lima, Ohio (built in 1965), and Lakewood, New York (built in 1971). When the deal is completed, Simon will concentrate on its larger malls, its outlet centers, and on overseas development.\\n\\u201cThese indoor malls in the middle of nowhere, which typically supplanted the old Main Street\\u2014that\\u2019s where it\\u2019s an anachronism,\\u201d Rick Caruso told me. But he still sees a place for malls elsewhere; after all, people have always needed gathering places, from the Lascaux caves, in France, with their Paleolithic paintings, to the modern-day souks of Marrakech. \\u201cHumans have an innate sense of wanting to come together,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI bet the souk will be there long after Amazon.\\u201d\\nCaruso\\u2019s showcase properties\\u2014the Grove, in Los Angeles, and the Americana at Brand, in Glendale, California\\u2014produce sales per square foot that rank them among the top fifteen malls worldwide. The Americana at Brand also houses more than two hundred apartments and a hundred condo units, so there\\u2019s no need for the residents to fight for a parking space. Both malls have a Main Street-meets-Vegas Strip feel, with skyrocketing fountains synchronized to music. The Grove boasts a fourteen-screen, Art Deco-style movie theatre. (Not long after the Grove opened, in 2002, the Los Angeles Times described its \\u201cstained-glass streetlights and Easter-colored fa\u00e7ades that are neither French nor Spanish but a low-volume Every Europe.\\u201d) The malls are busy, well-tended, and vibrant, though they are still malls: a simulacrum of culture, in the same way that the Cinderella Castle at Disney\\u2019s Magic Kingdom is a representation of medieval life, without the chamber pots and periodic sieges.\\nCaruso isn\\u2019t the first to pursue a vision of the mall as one facet of a thriving, if somewhat artificial-feeling, neighborhood rather than a distant fortress with an asphalt moat. That honor probably belongs to Victor Gruen, the father of the enclosed mall in America, and the subject of a 2004 Profile by Malcolm Gladwell. Sixty years ago, construction began on Gruen\\u2019s most famous project: the Southdale Center, in Edina, Minnesota, which ended up serving as the prototype for what has become the traditional mall. As Gladwell explains, Gruen envisioned Southdale at the center of a four-hundred-and-sixty-three-acre development that would include apartment buildings, schools, and a medical center. \\u201cSouthdale was not a suburban alternative to downtown Minneapolis,\\u201d Gladwell wrote. \\u201cIt was the Minneapolis downtown you would get if you started over and corrected all the mistakes that were made the first time around.\\u201d But the rest of the development never materialized. Years later, Gruen said that he was in \\u201csevere emotional shock\\u201d to see malls stranded in their acres of parking lots.\\nThe demise of the graybox is inspiring nostalgia among people who spent their teen-age years prowling its corridors. In 1989, Michael Galinsky, a filmmaker and photographer, drove across the country documenting malls and the people who frequented them. Decades later, when he posted the pictures online, they went viral. \\u201cPeople are reminded of something that they feel is lost of their former selves,\\u201d Galinsky told the Washington Post. In October, a German company published his photos in a book, \\u201cMalls Across America.\\u201d You can buy it on Amazon.\\nPhotograph by Brian Ulrich.\",\"title\":\"Are Malls Over?\",\"images\":[{\"primary\":\"true\",\"url\":\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/mall-580.jpg\"}],\"html\":\"<div><div class=\\\"entry-content\\\">\\n<article>\\n <p><img alt=\\\"mall-580.jpg\\\" class=\\\"mt-image-center diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"459\\\" src=\\\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/mall-580.jpg\\\" style=\\\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\\\" width=\\\"580\\\"><\\/img><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>When the Woodville Mall opened, in 1969, in Northwood, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, its developers bragged about the mall&rsquo;s million square feet of enclosed space; its anchor tenants, which included Sears and J.

In January, Rick Caruso, the C.E.O. of Caruso Affiliated, one of the largest privately held American real-estate companies, stood on a stage at the Javits Center, in New York, and forecast the demise of the traditional mall. &ldquo;Within ten to fifteen years, the typical U.S. mall, unless it is completely reinvented, will be a historical anachronism&mdash;a sixty-year aberration that no longer meets the public&rsquo;s needs, the retailers&rsquo; needs, or the community&rsquo;s needs,&rdquo; he told his audience, which had gathered for the National Retail Federation&rsquo;s annual convention.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Part of what&rsquo;s hurting the mall, obviously, is that, increasingly, people are shopping online. Internet sales reached <a href=\\\"http://research.nrffoundation.com/Default.aspx?pg=46\\\">six per cent<\\/a> of total retail spending in the fourth quarter of 2013, nearly doubling their share from 2006. Some retailers, understandably, are responding by focussing more on the online end of the retail business. Gap, which became synonymous with the American mall, is no longer counting on malls for growth. &ldquo;Culturally, the business pivoted towards digital,&rdquo; Glenn Murphy, the C.E.O., said, describing the past year. &ldquo;Mall traffic, for a number of years, has been slowing down. Whether it continues to decline somewhat over time, I think that&rsquo;s realistic to assume.&rdquo; Gap customers now can order clothes online and pick them up in a store. When it opens new stores this year, Gap will focus on Asia; earlier this month, the company launched its Old Navy brand in China.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine the future that Caruso described, in which malls are obsolete: the case for Amazon is pretty strong when the alternative is to crawl through gridlock to a mall, unwittingly park in the space farthest from the store you plan to visit, cringe as toddlers&rsquo; shrieks reverberate off the tile floors, and dodge salesmen hawking knockoff perfumes and hundred-dollar curling irons. But Caruso offers an interesting alternative scenario: what if malls reinvented themselves? As any cubicle dweller knows, people like natural light and fresh air and, when deprived of them, feel oppressed. So are people alienated by those older malls, with their raw concrete, brutalist architecture and fretful, defensive air? Developers have a shorthand for this style: the &ldquo;classic graybox.&rdquo; In his talk, Caruso flashed grim photos of their fa&ccedil;ades. He lingered on a picture of a deserted food court; you could practically smell the stale grease. &ldquo;Does this look like the future to you?&rdquo; he asked. On Monday, Sbarro, which represents one of the four food groups of mall cuisine, along with Jamba Juice, Panda Express, and Cinnabon, <a href=\\\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304250204579430960543691236?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304250204579430960543691236.html\\\">filed for bankruptcy protection<\\/a> for the second time in three years. Court papers cited an &ldquo;unprecedented decline in mall traffic,&rdquo; meaning fewer hungry shoppers settling for foldable pizza slices. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Caruso has a good reason to pitch the reinvention of malls to developers: outdoor malls are his company&rsquo;s focus. After his speech, he told me, an executive from one of the largest indoor-mall real-estate companies called to ask if his company could learn more about outdoor malls. But competitors aren&rsquo;t always so welcoming. In 2011, Caruso&rsquo;s company cancelled plans for an outdoor mall in the parking lot of the Santa Anita Park racetrack after a legal challenge from Westfield, which owned a nearby indoor mall, and a bankruptcy filing by Caruso&rsquo;s business partner.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Reinventing malls&mdash;and the stores that they house&mdash;might not be as straightforward as it seems. For all his shortcomings, Ron Johnson, the much criticized former C.E.O. of J. C. Penney, understood the warnings. He re&euml;nvisioned J. C. Penney stores, with their enormous&mdash;and enormously dated&mdash;open spaces, as places for people not only to shop but to hang out, drink coffee, and surf the Internet. His remodelling blueprints called for a &ldquo;street&rdquo; inside each store leading to a spacious &ldquo;square&rdquo; that could host yoga classes and other events. But there were two problems with the plan: sales were falling too quickly to support the tremendous renovation costs, and, even if J. C. Penney could have covered the expenses, the stores would have remained stuck in old-fashioned malls. In that sense, Johnson&rsquo;s previous job running Apple&rsquo;s retail stores was far simpler&mdash;just plunk down a gleaming glass cube on the most profitable shopping streets around the world. Now under new leadership, J. C. Penney has completed only a fraction of the remodelling plans.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Among developers, there&rsquo;s a tacit acknowledgment that the oldest, sickest malls, the kind that you associate with defunct chains like Waldenbooks and Tower Records, may be left to die. Meanwhile, there&rsquo;s money to be made from rich people in the U. S. and from everyone in Asia, where malls are not yet pass&eacute;. In October, Taubman Centers Inc. plans to open a mall anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue in Sarasota, Florida. Though designed as an indoor mall, it will have plenty of brightly lit storefronts that shoppers can enter from the parking lot, darting in and out like fish sampling bait. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>But, like Gap, Taubman sees its future in the two malls that it&rsquo;s developing in China and in a third mall, in South Korea. &ldquo;There is limited growth in the United States for new supply,&rdquo; Robert Taubman, the C.E.O., said recently. &ldquo;We think that, in the long term, China, Asia, represents an opportunity for us to continue to grow this company.&rdquo; Simon Property Group, another big developer, said in December that it will spin off into a separate company its strip centers and smaller enclosed malls in places like Lima, Ohio (built in 1965), and Lakewood, New York (built in 1971). When the deal is completed, Simon will concentrate on its larger malls, its outlet centers, and on overseas development. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;These indoor malls in the middle of nowhere, which typically supplanted the old Main Street&mdash;that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s an anachronism,&rdquo; Rick Caruso told me. But he still sees a place for malls elsewhere; after all, people have always needed gathering places, from the Lascaux caves, in France, with their Paleolithic paintings, to the modern-day souks of Marrakech. &ldquo;Humans have an innate sense of wanting to come together,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I bet the souk will be there long after Amazon.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Caruso&rsquo;s showcase properties&mdash;the Grove, in Los Angeles, and the Americana at Brand, in Glendale, California&mdash;produce sales per square foot that rank them among the top fifteen malls worldwide. The Americana at Brand also houses more than two hundred apartments and a hundred condo units, so there&rsquo;s no need for the residents to fight for a parking space. Both malls have a Main Street-meets-Vegas Strip feel, with skyrocketing fountains synchronized to music. The Grove boasts a fourteen-screen, Art Deco-style movie theatre. (Not long after the Grove opened, in 2002, the Los Angeles <i>Times<\\/i> described its &ldquo;stained-glass streetlights and Easter-colored fa&ccedil;ades that are neither French nor Spanish but a low-volume Every Europe.&rdquo;) The malls are busy, well-tended, and vibrant, though they are still malls: a simulacrum of culture, in the same way that the Cinderella Castle at Disney&rsquo;s Magic Kingdom is a representation of medieval life, without the chamber pots and periodic sieges.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Caruso isn&rsquo;t the first to pursue a vision of the mall as one facet of a thriving, if somewhat artificial-feeling, neighborhood rather than a distant fortress with an asphalt moat. That honor probably belongs to Victor Gruen, the father of the enclosed mall in America, and the subject of a 2004 <a href=\\\"http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/03/15/040315fa_fact1\\\">Profile<\\/a> by Malcolm Gladwell. Sixty years ago, construction began on Gruen&rsquo;s most famous project: the Southdale Center, in Edina, Minnesota, which ended up serving as the prototype for what has become the traditional mall. As Gladwell explains, Gruen envisioned Southdale at the center of a four-hundred-and-sixty-three-acre development that would include apartment buildings, schools, and a medical center. &ldquo;Southdale was not a suburban alternative to downtown Minneapolis,&rdquo; Gladwell wrote. &ldquo;It was the Minneapolis downtown you would get if you started over and corrected all the mistakes that were made the first time around.&rdquo; But the rest of the development never materialized. Years later, Gruen said that he was in &ldquo;severe emotional shock&rdquo; to see malls stranded in their acres of parking lots.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The demise of the graybox is inspiring nostalgia among people who spent their teen-age years prowling its corridors. In 1989, Michael Galinsky, a filmmaker and photographer, drove across the country documenting malls and the people who frequented them. Decades later, when he posted the pictures online, they went viral. &ldquo;People are reminded of something that they feel is lost of their former selves,&rdquo; Galinsky <a href=\\\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/white-flints-last-christmas-closing-of-a-past-retail-mecca-hints-at-an-american-eras-end/2013/12/22/26359656-6996-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html\\\">told<\\/a> the Washington <i>Post<\\/i>.

 "{\"text\":\"B U R E A U O F P U B L I C S E C R E T S\\n[revised version]\\nDuring the years in which the women\\u2019s liberation movement has been taking shape, a great emphasis has been placed on what are called leaderless, structureless groups as the main \\u2014 if not sole \\u2014 organizational form of the movement. The source of this idea was a natural reaction against the overstructured society in which most of us found ourselves, the inevitable control this gave others over our lives, and the continual elitism of the Left and similar groups among those who were supposedly fighting this overstructuredness.\\nThe idea of \\u201cstructurelessness,\\u201d however, has moved from a healthy counter to those tendencies to becoming a goddess in its own right. The idea is as little examined as the term is much used, but it has become an intrinsic and unquestioned part of women\\u2019s liberation ideology. For the early development of the movement this did not much matter. It early defined its main goal, and its main method, as consciousness-raising, and the \\u201cstructureless rap group\\u201d was an excellent means to this end. The looseness and informality of it encouraged participation in discussion, and its often supportive atmosphere elicited personal insight. If nothing more concrete than personal insight ever resulted from these groups, that did not much matter, because their purpose did not really extend beyond this.\\nThe basic problems didn\\u2019t appear until individual rap groups exhausted the virtues of consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do something more specific. At this point they usually floundered because most groups were unwilling to change their structure when they changed their tasks. Women had thoroughly accepted the idea of \\u201cstructurelessness\\u201d without realizing the limitations of its uses. People would try to use the \\u201cstructureless\\u201d group and the informal conference for purposes for which they were unsuitable out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be anything but oppressive.\\nIf the movement is to grow beyond these elementary stages of development, it will have to disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization and structure. There is nothing inherently bad about either of these. They can be and often are misused, but to reject them out of hand because they are misused is to deny ourselves the necessary tools to further development. We need to understand why \\u201cstructurelessness\\u201d does not work.\\nFormal and Informal Structures\\nContrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a \\u201cstructureless\\u201d group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible it may vary over time it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds, makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness and that is not the nature of a human group.\\nThis means that to strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as deceptive, as to aim at an \\u201cobjective\\u201d news story, \\u201cvalue-free\\u201d social science, or a \\u201cfree\\u201d economy. A \\u201claissezfaire\\u201d group is about as realistic as a \\u201claissezfaire\\u201d society; the idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others. This hegemony can so easily be established because the idea of \\u201cstructurelessness\\u201d does not prevent the formation of informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly \\u201claissezfaire\\u201d philosophy did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing control over wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented the government from doing so. Thus structurelessness becomes a way of masking power, and within the women\\u2019s movement it is usually most strongly advocated by those who are the most powerful (whether they are conscious of their power or not). As long as the structure of the group is informal, the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness of power is limited to those who know the rules. Those who do not know the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, or suffer from paranoid delusions that something is happening of which they are not quite aware.\\nFor everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. This is not to say that formalization of a structure of a group will destroy the informal structure. It usually doesn\\u2019t. But it does hinder the informal structure from having predominant control and makes available some means of attacking it if the people involved are not at least responsible to the needs of the group at large. \\u201cStructurelessness\\u201d is organizationally impossible. We cannot decide whether to have a structured or structureless group, only whether or not to have a formally structured one. Therefore the word will not be used any longer except to refer to the idea it represents. Unstructured will refer to those groups which have not been deliberately structured in a particular manner. Structured will refer to those which have. A structured group always has formal structure, and may also have an informal, or covert, structure. It is this informal structure, particularly in unstructured groups, which forms the basis for elites.\\nThe Nature of Elitism\\n\\u201cElitist\\u201d is probably the most abused word in the women\\u2019s liberation movement. It is used as frequently, and for the same reasons, as \\u201cpinko\\u201d was used in the fifties. It is rarely used correctly. Within the movement it commonly refers to individuals, though the personal characteristics and activities of those to whom it is directed may differ widely. An individual, as an individual, can never be an elitist, because the only proper application of the term \\u201celite\\u201d is to groups. Any individual, regardless of how well-known that person may be, can never be an elite.\\nCorrectly, an elite refers to a small group of people who have power over a larger group of which they are part, usually without direct responsibility to that larger group, and often without their knowledge or consent. A person becomes an elitist by being part of, or advocating the rule by, such a small group, whether or not that individual is wellknown or not known at all. Notoriety is not a definition of an elitist. The most insidious elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all. Intelligent elitists are usually smart enough not to allow themselves to become wellknown; when they become known, they are watched, and the mask over their power is no longer firmly lodged.\\nElites are not conspiracies. Very seldom does a small group of people get together and deliberately try to take over a larger group for its own ends. Elites are nothing more, and nothing less, than groups of friends who also happen to participate in the same political activities. They would probably maintain their friendship whether or not they were involved in political activities; they would probably be involved in political activities whether or not they maintained their friendships. It is the coincidence of these two phenomena which creates elites in any group and makes them so difficult to break.\\nThese friendship groups function as networks of communication outside any regular channels for such communication that may have been set up by a group. If no channels are set up, they function as the only networks of communication. Because these people are friends, because they usually share the same values and orientations, because they talk to each other socially and consult with each other when common decisions have to be made, the people involved in these networks have more power in the group than those who don\\u2019t. And it is a rare group that does not establish some informal networks of communication through the friends that are made in it.\\nSome groups, depending on their size, may have more than one such informal communications network. Networks may even overlap. When only one such network exists, it is the elite of an otherwise unstructured group, whether the participants in it want to be elitists or not. If it is the only such network in a structured group it may or may not be an elite depending on its composition and the nature of the formal structure. If there are two or more such networks of friends, they may compete for power within the group, thus forming factions, or one may deliberately opt out of the competition, leaving the other as the elite. In a structured group, two or more such friendship networks usually compete with each other for formal power. This is often the healthiest situation, as the other members are in a position to arbitrate between the two competitors for power and thus to make demands of those to whom they give their temporary allegiance.\\nThe inevitably elitist and exclusive nature of informal communication networks of friends is neither a new phenomenon characteristic of the women\\u2019s movement nor a phenomenon new to women. Such informal relationships have excluded women for centuries from participating in integrated groups of which they were a part. In any profession or organization these networks have created the \\u201clocker room\\u201d mentality and the \\u201cold school\\u201d ties which have effectively prevented women as a group (as well as some men individually) from having equal access to the sources of power or social reward. Much of the energy of past women\\u2019s movements has been directed to having the structures of decision-making and the selection processes formalized so that the exclusion of women could be confronted directly. As we well know, these efforts have not prevented the informal male-only networks from discriminating against women, but they have made it more difficult.\\nBecause elites are informal does not mean they are invisible. At any small group meeting anyone with a sharp eye and an acute ear can tell who is influencing whom. The member of a friendship group will relate more to each other than to other people. They listen more attentively, and interrupt less; they repeat each other\\u2019s points and give in amiably; they tend to ignore or grapple with the \\u201couts\\u201d whose approval is not necessary for making a decision. But it is necessary for the \\u201couts\\u201d to stay on good terms with the \\u201cins.\\u201d Of course the lines are not as sharp as I have drawn them. They are nuances of interaction, not prewritten scripts. But they are discernible, and they do have their effect. Once one knows with whom it is important to check before a decision is made, and whose approval is the stamp of acceptance, one knows who is running things.\\nSince movement groups have made no concrete decisions about who shall exercise power within them, many different criteria are used around the country. Most criteria are along the lines of traditional female characteristics. For instance, in the early days of the movement, marriage was usually a prerequisite for participation in the informal elite. As women have been traditionally taught, married women relate primarily to each other, and look upon single women as too threatening to have as close friends. In many cities, this criterion was further refined to include only those women married to New Left men. This standard had more than tradition behind it, however, because New Left men often had access to resources needed by the movement \\u2014 such as mailing lists, printing presses, contacts, and information \\u2014 and women were used to getting what they needed through men rather than independently. As the movement has changed through time, marriage has become a less universal criterion for effective participation, but all informal elites establish standards by which only women who possess certain material or personal characteristics may join. They frequently include: middle-class background (despite all the rhetoric about relating to the working class) being married not being married but living with someone being or pretending to be a lesbian being between the ages of twenty and thirty; being collegeeducated or at least having some college background being \\u201chip\\u201d not being too \\u201chip\\u201d holding a certain political line or identification as a \\u201cradical\\u201dhaving children or at least liking them; not having children; having certain \\u201cfeminine\\u201d personality characteristics such as being \\u201cnice\\u201d dressing right (whether in the traditional style or the antitraditional style) etc. There are also some characteristics which will almost always tag one as a \\u201cdeviant\\u201d who should not be related to. They include: being too old working full-time, particularly if one is actively committed to a \\u201ccareer\\u201d not being \\u201cnice\\u201d and being avowedly single (i.e. neither heterosexual nor homosexual).\\nOther criteria could be included, but they all have common themes. The characteristics prerequisite for participating in the informal elites of the movement, and thus for exercising power, concern one\\u2019s background, personality, or allocation of time. They do not include one\\u2019s competence, dedication to feminism, talents, or potential contribution to the movement. The former are the criteria one usually uses in determining one\\u2019s friends. The latter are what any movement or organization has to use if it is going to be politically effective.\\nThe criteria of participation may differ from group to group, but the means of becoming a member of the informal elite if one meets those criteria are pretty much the same. The only main difference depends on whether one is in a group from the beginning, or joins it after it has begun. If involved from the beginning it is important to have as many of one\\u2019s personal friends as possible also join. If no one knows anyone else very well, then one must deliberately form friendships with a select number and establish the informal interaction patterns crucial to the creation of an informal structure. Once the informal patterns are formed they act to maintain themselves, and one of the most successful tactics of maintenance is to continuously recruit new people who \\u201cfit in.\\u201d One joins such an elite much the same way one pledges a sorority. If perceived as a potential addition, one is \\u201crushed\\u201d by the members of the informal structure and eventually either dropped or initiated. If the sorority is not politically aware enough to actively engage in this process itself it can be started by the outsider pretty much the same way one joins any private club. Find a sponsor, i.e., pick some member of the elite who appears to be well respected within it, and actively cultivate that person\\u2019s friendship. Eventually, she will most likely bring you into the inner circle.\\nAll of these procedures take time. So if one works full time or has a similar major commitment, it is usually impossible to join simply because there are not enough hours left to go to all the meetings and cultivate the personal relationships necessary to have a voice in the decision-making. That is why formal structures of decision-making are a boon to the overworked person. Having an established process for decision-making ensures that everyone can participate in it to some extent.\\nAlthough this dissection of the process of elite formation within small groups has been critical in perspective, it is not made in the belief that these informal structures are inevitably bad \\u2014 merely that they are inevitable. All groups create informal structures as a result of interaction patterns among the members of the group. Such informal structures can do very useful things. But only unstructured groups are totally governed by them. When informal elites are combined with a myth of \\u201cstructurelessness,\\u201d there can be no attempt to put limits on the use of power. It becomes capricious.\\nThis has two potentially negative consequences of which we should be aware. The first is that the informal structure of decision-making will be much like a sorority one in which people listen to others because they like them and not because they say significant things. As long as the movement does not do significant things this does not much matter. But if its development is not to be arrested at this preliminary stage, it will have to alter this trend. The second is that informal structures have no obligation to be responsible to the group at large. Their power was not given to them; it cannot be taken away. Their influence is not based on what they do for the group; therefore they cannot be directly influenced by the group. This does not necessarily make informal structures irresponsible. Those who are concerned with maintaining their influence will usually try to be responsible. The group simply cannot compel such responsibility; it is dependent on the interests of the elite.\\nThe \\u201cStar\\u201d System\\nThe idea of \\u201cstructurelessness\\u201d has created the \\u201cstar\\u201d system. We live in a society which expects political groups to make decisions and to select people to articulate those decisions to the public at large. The press and the public do not know how to listen seriously to individual women as women; they want to know how the group feels. Only three techniques have ever been developed for establishing mass group opinion: the vote or referendum, the public opinion survey questionnaire, and the selection of group spokespeople at an appropriate meeting. The women\\u2019s liberation movement has used none of these to communicate with the public. Neither the movement as a whole nor most of the multitudinous groups within it have established a means of explaining their position on various issues. But the public is conditioned to look for spokespeople.\\nWhile it has consciously not chosen spokespeople, the movement has thrown up many women who have caught the public eye for varying reasons. These women represent no particular group or established opinion; they know this and usually say so. But because there are no official spokespeople nor any decision-making body that the press can query when it wants to know the movement\\u2019s position on a subject, these women are perceived as the spokespeople. Thus, whether they want to or not, whether the movement likes it or not, women of public note are put in the role of spokespeople by default.\\nThis is one source of the ire that is often felt towards the women who are labeled \\u201cstars.\\u201d Because they were not selected by the women in the movement to represent the movement\\u2019s views, they are resented when the press presumes that they speak for the movement. But as long as the movement does not select its own spokeswomen, such women will be placed in that role by the press and the public, regardless of their desires.\\nThis has several negative consequences for both the movement and the women labeled \\u201cstars.\\u201d First, because the movement didn\\u2019t put them in the role of spokesperson, the movement cannot remove them. The press put them there and only the press can choose not to listen. The press will continue to look to \\u201cstars\\u201d as spokeswomen as long as it has no official alternatives to go to for authoritative statements from the movement. The movement has no control in the selection of its representatives to the public as long as it believes that it should have no representatives at all. Second, women put in this position often find themselves viciously attacked by their sisters. This achieves nothing for the movement and is painfully destructive to the individuals involved. Such attacks only result in either the woman leaving the movement entirelyoften bitterly alienated \\u2014 or in her ceasing to feel responsible to her \\u201csisters.\\u201d She may maintain some loyalty to the movement, vaguely defined, but she is no longer susceptible to pressures from other women in it. One cannot feel responsible to people who have been the source of such pain without being a masochist, and these women are usually too strong to bow to that kind of personal pressure. Thus the backlash to the star system in effect encourages the very kind of individualistic nonresponsibility that the movement condemns. By purging a sister as a \\u201cstar,\\u201d the movement loses whatever control it may have had over the person who then becomes free to commit all of the individualistic sins of which she has been accused.\\nPolitical Impotence\\nUnstructured groups may be very effective in getting women to talk about their lives; they aren\\u2019t very good for getting things done. It is when people get tired of \\u201cjust talking\\u201d and want to do something more that the groups flounder, unless they change the nature of their operation. Occasionally, the developed informal structure of the group coincides with an available need that the group can fill in such a way as to give the appearance that an unstructured group \\u201cworks.\\u201d That is, the group has fortuitously developed precisely the kind of structure best suited for engaging in a particular project.\\nWhile working in this kind of group is a very heady experience, it is also rare and very hard to replicate. There are almost inevitably four conditions found in such a group:\\n1) It is task oriented. Its function is very narrow and very specific, like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task that basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to be done and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people can judge their actions and make plans for future activity.\\n2) It is relatively small and homogeneous. Homogeneity is necessary to ensure that participants have a common language or interaction. People from widely different backgrounds may provide richness to a consciousness-raising group where each can learn from the others\\u2019 experience, but too great a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse people interpret words and actions differently. They have different expectations about each other\\u2019s behavior and judge the results according to different criteria. If everyone knows everyone else well enough to understand the nuances, these can be accommodated. Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise.\\n3) There is a high degree of communication. Information must be passed on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can be passed around easily.\\n4) There is a low degree of skill specialization. Not everyone has to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by more than one person. Thus no one is indispensable. To a certain extent, people become interchangeable parts.\\nWhile these conditions can occur serendipitously in small groups, this is not possible in large ones. Consequently, because the larger movement in most cities is as unstructured as individual rap groups, it is not too much more effective than the separate groups at specific tasks. The informal structure is rarely together enough or in touch enough with the people to be able to operate effectively. So the movement generates much motion and few results. Unfortunately, the consequences of all this motion are not as innocuous as the results, and their victim is the movement itself.\\nSome groups have formed themselves into local action projects if they do not involve many people and work on a small scale. But this form restricts movement activity to the local level; it cannot be done on the regional or national. Also, to function well the groups must usually pare themselves down to that informal group of friends who were running things in the first place. This excludes many women from participating. As long as the only way women can participate in the movement is through membership in a small group, the nongregarious are at a distinct disadvantage. As long as friendship groups are the main means of organizational activity, elitism becomes institutionalized.\\nFor those groups which cannot find a local project to which to devote themselves, the mere act of staying together becomes the reason for their staying together. When a group has no specific task (and consciousness-raising is a task), the people in it turn their energies to controlling others in the group. This is not done so much out of a malicious desire to manipulate others (though sometimes it is) as out of a lack of anything better to do with their talents. Able people with time on their hands and a need to justify their coming together put their efforts into personal control, and spend their time criticizing the personalities of the other members in the group. Infighting and personal power games rule the day. When a group is involved in a task, people learn to get along with others as they are and to subsume personal dislikes for the sake of the larger goal. There are limits placed on the compulsion to remold every person in our image of what they should be.\\nThe end of consciousness-raising leaves people with no place to go, and the lack of structure leaves them with no way of getting there. The women the movement either turn in on themselves and their sisters or seek other alternatives of action. There are few that are available. Some women just do their own thing. This can lead to a great deal of individual creativity, much of which is useful for the movement, but it is not a viable alternative for most women and certainly does not foster a spirit of cooperative group effort. Other women drift out of the movement entirely because they don\\u2019t want to develop an individual project and they have found no way of discovering, joining, or starting group projects that interest them.\\nMany turn to other political organizations to give them the kind of structured, effective activity that they have not been able to find in the women\\u2019s movement. Those political organizations which see women\\u2019s liberation as only one of many issues to which women should devote their time thus find the movement a vast recruiting ground for new members. There is no need for such organizations to infiltrate (though this is not precluded). The desire for meaningful political activity generated in women by their becoming part of the women\\u2019s liberation movement is sufficient to make them eager to join other organizations when the movement itself provides no outlets for their new ideas and energies.\\nThose women who join other political organizations while remaining within the women\\u2019s liberation movement, or who join women\\u2019s liberation while remaining in other political organizations, in turn become the framework for new informal structures. These friendship networks are based upon their common nonfeminist politics rather than the characteristics discussed earlier, but operate in much the same way. Because these women share common values, ideas, and political orientations, they too become informal, unplanned, unselected, unresponsible elites \\u2014 whether they intend to be so or not.\\nThese new informal elites are often perceived as threats by the old informal elites previously developed within different movement groups. This is a correct perception. Such politically oriented networks are rarely willing to be merely \\u201csororities\\u201d as many of the old ones were, and want to proselytize their political as well as their feminist ideas. This is only natural, but its implications for women\\u2019s liberation have never been adequately discussed. The old elites are rarely willing to bring such differences of opinion out into the open because it would involve exposing the nature of the informal structure of the group. Many of these informal elites have been hiding under the banner of anti-elitism and \\u201cstructurelessness.\\u201d To effectively counter the competition from another informal structure, they would have to become \\u201cpublic,\\u201d and this possibility is fraught with many dangerous implications. Thus, to maintain its own power, it is easier to rationalize the exclusion of the members of the other informal structure by such means as \\u201cred-baiting,\\u201d \\u201creformist-baiting,\\u201d \\u201clesbian-baiting,\\u201d or \\u201cstraight-baiting.\\u201d The only other alternative is to formally structure the group in such a way that the original power structure is institutionalized. This is not always possible. If the informal elites have been well structured and have exercised a fair amount of power in the past, such a task is feasible. These groups have a history of being somewhat politically effective in the past, as the tightness of the informal structure has proven an adequate substitute for a formal structure. Becoming structured does not alter their operation much, though the institutionalization of the power structure does open it to formal challenge. It is those groups which are in greatest need of structure that are often least capable of creating it. Their informal structures have not been too well formed and adherence to the ideology of structurelessness makes them reluctant to change tactics. The more unstructured a group is, the more lacking it is in informal structures, and the more it adheres to an ideology of structurelessness, the more vulnerable it is to being taken over by a group of political comrades.\\nSince the movement at large is just as unstructured as most of its constituent groups, it is similarly susceptible to indirect influence. But the phenomenon manifests itself differently. On a local level most groups can operate autonomously; but the only groups that can organize a national activity are nationally organized groups. Thus, it is often the structured feminist organizations that provide national direction for feminist activities, and this direction is determined by the priorities of those organizations. Such groups as NOW, WEAL, and some leftist women\\u2019s caucuses are simply the only organizations capable of mounting a national campaign. The multitude of unstructured women\\u2019s liberation groups can choose to support or not support the national campaigns, but are incapable of mounting their own. Thus their members become the troops under the leadership of the structured organizations. The avowedly unstructured group has no way of drawing upon the movement\\u2019s vast resources to support its priorities. It doesn\\u2019t even have a way of deciding what those priorities are.\\nThe more unstructured a movement is, the less control it has over the directions in which it develops and the political actions in which it engages. This does not mean that its ideas do not spread. Given a certain amount of interest by the media and the appropriateness of social conditions, the ideas will still be diffused widely. But diffusion of ideas does not mean they are implemented; it only means they are talked about. Insofar as they can be applied individually they may be acted on; insofar as they require coordinated political power to be implemented, they will not be.\\nAs long as the women\\u2019s liberation movement stays dedicated to a form of organization which stresses small, inactive discussion groups among friends, the worst problems of unstructuredness will not be felt. But this style of organization has its limits; it is politically inefficacious, exclusive, and discriminatory against those women who are not or cannot be tied into the friendship networks. Those who do not fit into what already exists because of class, race, occupation, education, parental or marital status, personality, etc., will inevitably be discouraged from trying to participate. Those who do fit in will develop vested interests in maintaining things as they are.\\nThe informal groups\\u2019 vested interests will be sustained by the informal structures which exist, and the movement will have no way of determining who shall exercise power within it. If the movement continues deliberately to not select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do exercise power and influence be responsible for it. If the movement continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because it knows it cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does prevent any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously ensures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle ground between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found.\\nThese problems are coming to a head at this time because the nature of the movement is necessarily changing. Consciousness-raising as the main function of the women\\u2019s liberation movement is becoming obsolete. Due to the intense press publicity of the last two years and the numerous overground books and articles now being circulated, women\\u2019s liberation has become a household word. Its issues are discussed and informal rap groups are formed by people who have no explicit connection with any movement group. The movement must go on to other tasks. It now needs to establish its priorities, articulate its goals, and pursue its objectives in a coordinated fashion. To do this it must get organized \\u2014 locally, regionally, and nationally.\\nPrinciples of Democratic Structuring\\nOnce the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of structurelessness, it is free to develop those forms of organization best suited to its healthy functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organization. But neither should we blindly reject them all. Some of the traditional techniques will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights into what we should and should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques to use for different situations. The Lot System is one such idea which has emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, but is useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed. But before we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that there is nothing inherently bad about structure itself \\u2014 only its excess use.\\nWhile engaging in this trial-and-error process, there are some principles we can keep in mind that are essential to democratic structuring and are also politically effective:\\n1) Delegation of specific authority to specific individuals for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume jobs or tasks only by default means they are not dependably done. If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment which cannot so easily be ignored.\\n2) Requiring all those to whom authority has been delegated to be responsible to those who selected them. This is how the group has control over people in positions of authority. Individuals may exercise power, but it is the group that has ultimate say over how the power is exercised.\\n3) Distribution of authority among as many people as is reasonably possible. This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in positions of authority to consult with many others in the process of exercising it. It also gives many people the opportunity to have responsibility for specific tasks and thereby to learn different skills.\\n4) Rotation of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which are held too long by one person, formally or informally, come to be seen as that person\\u2019s property and are not easily relinquished or controlled by the group. Conversely, if tasks are rotated too frequently the individual does not have time to learn her job well and acquire the sense of satisfaction of doing a good job.\\n5) Allocation of tasks along rational criteria. Selecting someone for a position because they are liked by the group or giving them hard work because they are disliked serves neither the group nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest, and responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do not have, but this is best done through some sort of apprenticeship program rather than the sink or swimmethod. Having a responsibility one can\\u2019t handle well is demoralizing. Conversely, being blacklisted from doing what one can do well does not encourage one to develop one\\u2019s skills. Women have been punished for being competent throughout most of human history; the movement does not need to repeat this process.\\n6) Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible. Information is power. Access to information enhances one\\u2019s power. When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion \\u2014 without the group participating. The more one knows about how things work and what is happening, the more politically effective one can be.\\n7) Equal access to resources needed by the group. This is not always perfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member who maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing press owned by a husband, or a darkroom) can unduly influence the use of that resource. Skills and information are also resources. Members\\u2019 skills can be equitably available only when members are willing to teach what they know to others.\\nWhen these principles are applied, they ensure that whatever structures are developed by different movement groups will be controlled by and responsible to the group. The group of people in positions of authority will be diffuse, flexible, open, and temporary. They will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at large, The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise authority within it.\\nJO FREEMAN 1970\\nThis article by Jo Freeman (a.k.a. Joreen) has been widely reproduced, and deservedly so. Though originally addressed to the early women\\u2019s liberation movement, it remains applicable to other areas of radical struggle. I also recommend it to your attention as a fine example of theoretical lucidity and modesty. Notice how thoughtfully Freeman presents the ramifications of this particular issue, setting out the factors that people need to consider without offering simplistic solutions or indulging in heated rhetoric. This sounds easy, but it is all too rare in the arena of political debate.\\nThese merits can perhaps be appreciated more clearly by noting the contrast with Cathy Levine\\u2019s response, The Tyranny of Tyranny. Levine\\u2019s text may at first seem to present a more radical viewpoint, but if you examine it carefully I think you will see that it actually does little but evade the issue. Freeman addressed an undeniable problem that was already beginning to be widely recognized, and drew attention to the important distinction between groups (whether large or small) that have explicit structures and those that have hidden ones. Instead of facing this problem, Levine drowns it out with oversimplified platitudes about the evils of large groups and the virtues of small ones, then goes off on a variety of irrelevant tangential issues. Those issues may be important in other contexts; and Freeman\\u2019s activities and perspectives may have been less radical in other regards (see her own of the period). The point is that at this particular juncture Freeman made an exemplary theoretical contribution, while Levine\\u2019s response is a good example of the opposite \\u2014 of ideology and the counterproductive role it always serves.\\nAs far as I know, this piece is not copyrighted.

The source of this idea was a natural reaction against the\\noverstructured society in which most of us found ourselves, the inevitable control this\\ngave others over our lives, and the continual elitism of the Left and similar groups among\\nthose who were supposedly fighting this overstructuredness. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The idea of &ldquo;structurelessness,&rdquo; however, has moved from a healthy counter to\\nth<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">o<\\/span>se tendencies to becoming a goddess in its own right. The idea is as little examined as\\nthe term is much used, but it has become an intrinsic and unquestioned part of\\nwomen&rsquo;s liberation ideology. For the early development of the movement this did not\\nmuch matter. It early defined its main <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">goal, and its main\\n<\\/span>method<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> as consciousness-raising, and the\\n&ldquo;structureless rap group&rdquo; was an excellent means to this end. \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">The<\\/span> looseness and\\ninformality <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">of it <\\/span>encouraged participation in discussion<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> and \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">its<\\/span> often supportive atmosphere\\nelicited personal insight. If nothing more concrete than personal insight ever resulted\\nfrom these groups, that did not much matter, because their purpose did not really extend\\nbeyond this. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The basic problems didn&rsquo;t appear until individual rap groups exhausted the virtues\\nof consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do something more specific. At this\\npoint they usually floundered because most groups were unwilling to change their structure\\nwhen they changed their task<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s<\\/span>. Women had thoroughly accepted the idea of\\n&ldquo;structurelessness&rdquo; without realizing the limitations of its uses. People would\\ntry to use the &ldquo;structureless&rdquo; group and the informal conference for purposes\\nfor which they were unsuitable out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be\\nanything but oppressive. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>If the movement is to <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">grow<\\/span> beyond these elementary stages of development, it will have\\nto disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization and structure. There is\\nnothing inherently bad about either of these. They can be and often are misused, but to\\nreject them out of hand because they are misused is to deny ourselves the necessary tools\\nto further development. We need to understand why &ldquo;structurelessness&rdquo; does not\\nwork. <\\/p>\\n\\n<h3 align=\\\"center\\\"><br>\\nFormal and Informal Structures <\\/h3>\\n\\n<p>Contrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a\\n&ldquo;structureless&rdquo; group. Any group of people of whatever nature \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">that comes<\\/span> together\\nfor any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in some fashion.\\nThe structure may be flexible it may vary over time it may evenly or unevenly distribute\\ntasks, power and resources over the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless\\nof the abilities, personalities<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">, or<\\/span> intentions of the people involved. The very fact that\\nwe are individuals<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> with different talents, predispositions<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> and backgrounds<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> makes this\\ninevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any basis whatsoever could we\\napproximate  structurelessness and that is not the nature of a human group. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This means that to strive for a  structureless group is as useful, and as\\ndeceptive, as to aim at an &ldquo;objective&rdquo; news story, &ldquo;value-free&rdquo; social\\nscience<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> or a &ldquo;free&rdquo; economy. A &ldquo;laissez<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">\\n<\\/span>faire&rdquo; group is about as\\nrealistic as a &ldquo;laissez<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\"> <\\/span>faire&rdquo; society; the idea becomes a smokescreen for the\\nstrong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others. This hegemony can\\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">so <\\/span>easily be established because the idea of &ldquo;structurelessness&rdquo; does not prevent\\nthe formation of informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly\\n&ldquo;laissez<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\"> <\\/span>faire&rdquo; philosophy did not prevent the economically powerful from\\nestablishing control over wages, prices<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> and distribution of goods; it only prevented the\\ngovernment from doing so. Thus  structurelessness becomes a way of masking\\npower, and within the women&rsquo;s movement it is usually most strongly advocated by those\\nwho are the most powerful (whether they are conscious of their power or not). \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">As long as the structure of the group is informal, the<\\/span> rules of\\nhow decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness of power is \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">limited to<\\/span>\\nthose who know the rules. Those who do\\nnot know the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, or suffer\\nfrom paranoid delusions that something is happening of which they are not quite aware. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate\\nin its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit. The rules of\\ndecision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can happen \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">only <\\/span>if they\\nare formalized. This is not to say that <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">f<\\/span>ormalization of a structure \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">of a group <\\/span>will destroy\\nthe informal structure. It usually doesn&rsquo;t. But it does hinder the informal structure\\nfrom having predominant control and makes available some means of attacking it<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\"> \\nif the people involved are not at least responsible to the needs of the group at \\nlarge<\\/span>.\\n&ldquo;Structurelessness&rdquo; is organizationally impossible. We cannot decide whether to\\nhave a structured or structureless group<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> only whether or not to have a <em>formally<\\/em>\\nstructured one. Therefore the word will not be used any longer except to refer to the\\nidea it represents. <em style=\\\"font-style: normal\\\">Unstructured<\\/em> will refer to those groups which have not\\nbeen deliberately structured in a particular manner. \\n<em style=\\\"font-style: normal\\\">Structured<\\/em> \\nwill refer to those which have. A structured group always has \\n<em style=\\\"font-style: normal\\\">formal<\\/em> structure, and may also\\nhave an informal<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">, or covert, structure<\\/span>. It is this informal structure, particularly in unstructured groups, which forms\\nthe basis for elites. <\\/p>\\n\\n<h3 align=\\\"center\\\"><br>\\nThe Nature of Elitism <\\/h3>\\n\\n<p>&ldquo;Elitist&rdquo; is probably the most abused word in the women&rsquo;s liberation\\nmovement. It is used as frequently, and for the same reasons, as &ldquo;pinko&rdquo; was \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">used <\\/span>in\\nthe <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">fifties<\\/span>. It is <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">rarely<\\/span> used correctly. Within the movement it commonly refers to\\nindividuals, though the personal characteristics and activities of those to whom it is\\ndirected may differ widely. An individual, as an individual, can never be an\\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">elitist,<\\/span> because the only proper application of the term &ldquo;elite&rdquo; is to\\ngroups. Any individual, regardless of how well-known that person \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">may be<\\/span>, can never be an\\nelite. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Correctly, an elite refers to a small group of people who have power over a larger\\ngroup of which they are part, usually without direct responsibility to that larger group,\\nand often without their knowledge or consent. A person becomes an elitist by being part\\nof, or advocating the rule by<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> such a small group, whether or not that individual is\\nwell<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\"> <\\/span>known or not known at all. Notoriety is not a definition of an elitist. The most\\ninsidious elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all.\\nIntelligent elitists are usually smart enough not to allow themselves to become\\nwell<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\"> <\\/span>known<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">; w<\\/span>hen they become known, they are watched, and the mask over their power is no\\nlonger firmly lodged. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Elites are not conspiracies. <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">Very s<\\/span>eldom does a small group of people get together and \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">deliberately <\\/span>try\\nto take over a larger group for its own ends. Elites are nothing more<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> and nothing less<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span>\\nthan group<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s<\\/span> of friends who also happen to participate in the same political activities.\\nThey would probably maintain their friendship whether or not they were involved in\\npolitical activities; they would probably be involved in political activities whether or\\nnot they maintained their friendships. It is the coincidence of these two phenomena which\\ncreates elites in any group and makes them so difficult to break. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>These friendship groups function as networks of communication outside any regular\\nchannels for such communication that may have been set up by a group. If no channels are\\nset up, they function as the <em>only<\\/em> networks of communication. Because these people\\nare friends, <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">because they <\\/span>usually shar<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">e<\\/span> the same values and orientations, because they talk to each\\nother socially and consult with each other when common decisions have to be made, the\\npeople involved in these networks have more power in the group than those who don&rsquo;t.\\nAnd it is a rare group that does not establish some informal networks of communication\\nthrough the friends that are made in it. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Some groups, depending on their size, may have more than one such informal\\ncommunication<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s<\\/span> network. Networks may even overlap. When only one such network exists, it is\\nthe elite of an otherwise unstructured group, whether the participants in it want to be\\nelitists or not. If it is the only such network in a structured group it may or may not be\\nan elite depending on its composition and the nature of the formal structure. If there are\\ntwo or more such networks of friends, they may compete for power within the group, thus\\nforming factions, or one may deliberately opt out of the competition<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> leaving the other as\\nthe elite. In a structured group, two or more such friendship networks usually compete\\nwith each other for formal power. This is often the healthiest situation<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">, \\nas t<\\/span>he other\\nmembers are in a position to arbitrate between the two competitors for power and thus to make demands of th<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">ose<\\/span> to whom they give their temporary allegiance. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The \\ninevitably elitist and exclusive nature of informal communication networks of \\nfriends is neither a new phenomenon characteristic of the women&rsquo;s movement nor a \\nphenomenon new to women. Such informal relationships have excluded women for \\ncenturies from participating in integrated groups of which they were a part. In \\nany profession or organization these networks have created the &ldquo;locker room&rdquo; \\nmentality and the &ldquo;old school&rdquo; ties which have effectively prevented women as a \\ngroup (as well as some men individually) from having equal access to the sources \\nof power or social reward. Much of the energy of past women&rsquo;s movements has been \\ndirected to having the structures of decision-making and the selection processes \\nformalized so that the exclusion of women could be confronted directly. As we \\nwell know, these efforts have not prevented the informal male-only networks from \\ndiscriminating against women, but they have made it more difficult.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Because elites are informal does not mean they are invisible. At any small group\\nmeeting anyone with a sharp eye and an acute ear can tell who is influencing whom. The\\nmember of a friendship group will relate more to each other than to other people. They\\nlisten more attentively<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> and interrupt less<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">; \\nt<\\/span>hey repeat each other&rsquo;s points and give\\nin amiably<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">; they tend to ignore or grapple with t<\\/span>he &ldquo;outs&rdquo; \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">whose<\\/span> approval is not necessary for making a decision<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">. \\nBut<\\/span> it\\nis necessary for the &ldquo;outs&rdquo; to stay on good terms with the &ldquo;ins.&rdquo; Of\\ncourse the lines are not as sharp as I have drawn them. They are nuances of interaction,\\nnot prewritten scripts. But they are discernible, and they do have their effect. Once one\\nknows with whom it is important to check before a decision is made, and whose approval is\\nthe stamp of acceptance, one knows who is running things. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Since movement groups have made no concrete decisions about who shall exercise power\\nwithin them, many different criteria are used around the country. \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">Most criteria are along the lines of traditional female \\ncharacteristics. For instance, in the early days of the movement, marriage was \\nusually a prerequisite for participation in the informal elite. As women have \\nbeen traditionally taught, married women relate primarily to each other, and \\nlook upon single women as too threatening to have as close friends. In many \\ncities, this criterion was further refined to include only those women married \\nto New Left men. This standard had more than tradition behind it, however, \\nbecause New Left men often had access to resources needed by the movement &mdash; \\nsuch as mailing lists, printing presses, contacts, and information &mdash; and women \\nwere used to getting what they needed through men rather than independently.\\n<\\/span>As the movement has\\nchanged through time, marriage has become a less universal criterion for effective\\nparticipation, <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">but<\\/span> all informal elites establish standards by which only women\\nwho possess certain material or personal characteristics may join. The<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">y<\\/span>\\nfrequently include: middle-class background (despite all the rhetoric about relating to\\nthe working class) being married not being married but living with someone being or\\npretending to be a lesbian being between the age<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s \\nof twenty and thirty;<\\/span> being college<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\"> <\\/span>educated or\\nat least having some college background being &ldquo;hip&rdquo; not being too\\n&ldquo;hip&rdquo; holding a certain political line or identification as a\\n&ldquo;radical&rdquo; <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">having \\nchildren or at least liking them; not having children; <\\/span>having certain &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; personality characteristics such\\nas being &ldquo;nice&rdquo; dressing right (whether in the traditional style or the\\nantitraditional style) etc. There are also some characteristics which will almost always\\ntag one as a &ldquo;deviant&rdquo; who should not be related to. They include: being too\\nold working full-time<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> particularly if one is actively committed to a\\n&ldquo;career&rdquo; not being &ldquo;nice&rdquo; and being avowedly single (i.e. neither\\nheterosexual nor homosexual). <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Other criteria could be included, but they all have common themes. The characteristic<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s<\\/span>\\nprerequisite for participating in the informal elites of the movement, and thus for\\nexercising power, concern one&rsquo;s background, personality<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> or allocation of time. They\\ndo not include one&rsquo;s competence, dedication to feminism, talents<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> or potential\\ncontribution to the movement. The former are the criteria one usually uses in determining\\none&rsquo;s friends. The latter are what any movement or organization has to use if it is\\ngoing to be politically effective. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>The \\n    criteria of participation may differ from group to group, but the means of \\n    becoming a member of the informal elite if one meets those criteria ar<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">e<\\/span> \\n    pretty much the same. The only main difference depends on whether one is in \\n    a group from the beginning, or joins it after it has begun. If involved from \\n    the beginning it is important to have as many of one&rsquo;s personal friends as \\n    possible also join. If no one knows anyone else very well, then one must \\n    deliberately form friendships with a select number and establish the \\n    informal interaction patterns crucial to the creation of an informal \\n    structure. Once the informal patterns are formed they act to maintain \\n    themselves, and one of the most successful tactics of maintenance is to \\n    continuously recruit new people who &ldquo;fit in.&rdquo; One joins such an elite much \\n    the same way one pledges a sorority. If perceived as a potential addition, \\n    one is &ldquo;rushed&rdquo; by the members of the informal structure and eventually \\n    either dropped or initiated. If the sorority is not politically aware enough \\n    to actively engage in this process itself it can be started by the outsider \\n    pretty much the same way one joins any private club. Find a sponsor, i.e., \\n    pick some member of the elite who appears to be well respected within it, \\n    and actively cultivate that person&rsquo;s friendship. Eventually, she will most \\n    likely bring you into the inner circle.<\\/p>\\n    \\n    <p>All \\n    of these procedures take time. So if one works full time or has a similar \\n    major commitment, it is usually impossible to join simply because there are \\n    not enough hours left to go to all the meetings and cultivate the personal \\n    relationship<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s<\\/span> necessary to have a voice in the decision-making. That is why \\n    formal structures of decision<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">-<\\/span>making are a boon to the overworked person. \\n    Having an established process for decision-making ensures that everyone can \\n    participate in it to some extent.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>Although this dissection of the process of elite formation within small groups has been\\ncritical in perspective, it is not made in the belief that these informal structures\\nare inevitably bad &mdash; merely that they are inevitable. All groups create informal\\nstructures as a result of interaction patterns among the members<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\"> \\nof the group<\\/span>. Such informal\\nstructures can do very useful things. But only unstructured groups are totally governed by\\nthem. When informal elites are combined with a myth of &ldquo;structurelessness,&rdquo;\\nthere can be no attempt to put limits on the use of power. It becomes capricious. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This has two potentially negative consequences of which we should be aware. The first\\nis that the informal structure of decision<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">-<\\/span>making will be \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">much <\\/span>like a sorority one in which\\npeople listen to others because they like them<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\"> and<\\/span> not because they say significant things.\\nAs long as the movement does not do significant things this does not much matter. But if\\nits development is not to be arrested at this preliminary stage, it will have to alter\\nthis trend. The second is that informal structures have no obligation to be responsible to\\nthe group at large. Their power was not given to them; it cannot be taken away. Their\\ninfluence is not based on what they do for the group; therefore they cannot be directly\\ninfluenced by the group. This does not necessarily make informal structures irresponsible.\\nThose who are concerned with maintaining their influence will usually try to be\\nresponsible. The group simply cannot compel such responsibility; it is dependent on the\\ninterests of the elite. <\\/p>\\n\\n<h3 align=\\\"center\\\"><br>\\nThe &ldquo;Star&rdquo; System <\\/h3>\\n\\n<p>The  idea of &ldquo;structurelessness&rdquo; has created the &ldquo;star&rdquo;\\nsystem. We live in a society which expects political groups to make decisions and to\\nselect people to articulate those decisions to the public at large. The press and the\\npublic do not know how to listen seriously to individual women as women; they want to know\\nhow the group feels. Only three techniques have ever been developed for establishing mass\\ngroup opinion: the vote or referendum, the public opinion survey questionnaire<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> and the\\nselection of group spokespeople at an appropriate meeting. The women&rsquo;s liberation\\nmovement has used none of these to communicate with the public. Neither the movement as a\\nwhole nor most of the multitudinous groups within it have established a means of\\nexplaining their position on various issues. But the public is conditioned to look for\\nspokespeople. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>While it has consciously not chosen spokespeople, the movement has thrown up many women\\nwho have caught the public eye for varying reasons. These women represent no particular\\ngroup or established opinion; they know this and usually say so. But because there are no\\nofficial spokespeople nor any decision<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">-<\\/span>making body \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">that <\\/span>the press can <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">query<\\/span> when it wants to\\nknow the movement&rsquo;s position on a subject, these women are perceived as the\\nspokespeople. Thus, whether they want to or not, whether the movement likes it or not,\\nwomen of public note are put in the role of spokespeople by default. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This is one source of the <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">ire<\\/span> that is often felt towards the women who are labeled\\n&ldquo;stars.&rdquo; Because they were not selected by the women in the movement to\\nrepresent the movement&rsquo;s views, they are resented when the press presumes \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">that <\\/span>they speak\\nfor the movement. <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">But as long as the movement does not select \\nits own spokeswomen, such women will be placed in that role by the press and the \\npublic, regardless of their desires.<\\/span><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>This has several \\nnegative consequences for both the movement and the women labeled &ldquo;stars.&rdquo; \\nFirst, because the movement didn&rsquo;t put them in the role of spokesperson, the \\nmovement cannot remove them. The press put them there and only the press can \\nchoose not to listen. The press will continue to look to &ldquo;stars&rdquo; as spokeswomen \\nas long as it has no official alternatives to go to for authoritative statements \\nfrom the movement. The movement has no control in the selection of its \\nrepresentatives to the public as long as it believes that it should have no \\nrepresentatives at all. Second, women put in this position often find themselves \\nviciously attacked by their sisters. This achieves nothing for the movement and \\nis painfully destructive to the individuals involved. Such attacks only result \\nin either the woman leaving the movement entirelyoften bitterly alienated &mdash; or \\nin her ceasing to feel responsible to her &ldquo;sisters.&rdquo; She may maintain some \\nloyalty to the movement, vaguely defined, but she is no longer susceptible to \\npressures from other women in it. One cannot feel responsible to people who have \\nbeen the source of such pain without being a masochist, and these women are \\nusually too strong to bow to that kind of personal pressure. Thus the backlash \\nto the star system in effect encourages the very \\nkind of individualistic nonresponsibility that the movement condemns. By purging \\na sister as a &ldquo;star,&rdquo; the movement loses whatever control it may have had over \\nthe person who then becomes free to commit all of the individualistic sins of \\nwhich she has been accused.<\\/p>\\n\\n<h3 align=\\\"center\\\"><br>\\nPolitical Impotence <\\/h3>\\n\\n<p>Unstructured groups may be very effective in getting women to talk about their lives;\\nthey aren&rsquo;t very good for getting things done. <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">It is \\nwhen people get tired of &ldquo;just talking&rdquo; and want to do something more that the \\ngroups flounder, unless they change the nature of their<\\/span> operation. \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">Occasionally, the developed informal structure of the group \\ncoincides with an available need that the group can fill in such a way as to \\ngive the appearance that an unstructured group &ldquo;works.&rdquo; That is, the group has \\nfortuitously developed precisely the kind of structure best suited for engaging \\nin a particular project.<\\/span><\\/p>\\n\\n<p>While \\n    working in this kind of group is a very heady experience, it is also rare \\n    and very hard to replicate. There are almost inevitably four conditions \\n    found in such a group:<\\/p>\\n    <blockquote>\\n\\n<p>1)<i> \\n    It is task oriented<\\/i>. Its function is very narrow and very specific, like \\n    putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task that \\n    basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to be done \\n    and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people can judge \\n    their actions and make plans for future activity.\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>2)\\n    <i>It is relatively small and homogeneous<\\/i>. Homogeneity is necessary to \\n    <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">e<\\/span>nsure that participants have a common language or interaction. People \\n    from widely different backgrounds may provide richness to a \\n    consciousness-raising group where each can learn from the others&rsquo; \\n    experience, but too great a diversity among members of a task-oriented group \\n    means only that they continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse \\n    people interpret words and actions differently. They have different \\n    expectations about each other&rsquo;s behavior and judge the results according to \\n    different criteria. If everyone knows everyone else well enough to \\n    understand the nuances, these can be accommodated. Usually, they only lead \\n    to confusion and endless hours spent straightening out conflicts no one ever \\n    thought would arise. <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>3)\\n    <i>There is a high degree of communication<\\/i>. Information must be passed \\n    on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured \\n    in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small and \\n    people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the task. \\n    Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve everybody \\n    increases geometrically with the number of participants. This inevitably \\n    limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from some of the \\n    decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, but only when they \\n    are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which perform specific \\n    parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each other so that \\n    knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can be passed around \\n    easily.\\n     <\\/p>\\n\\n<p>4)\\n    <i>There is a low degree of skill specialization<\\/i>. Not everyone has to be \\nable to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by more than one \\nperson. Thus no one is indispensable. To a certain extent, people become \\ninterchangeable parts<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">.<\\/span><\\/p>\\n    <\\/blockquote>\\n\\n<p>While\\n    these conditions can occur serendipitously in small groups, this is not \\n    possible in large ones. Consequently, because the larger movement in most \\n    cities is as unstructured as individual rap groups, it is not too much more \\n    effective than the separate groups at specific tasks. The informal structure \\n    is rarely together enough or in touch enough with the people to be able to \\n    operate effectively. So the movement generates much motion and few results. \\n    Unfortunately, the consequences of all this motion are not as innocuous as \\n    the results<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">,<\\/span> and their victim is the movement itself.\\n    \\n    \\n\\n<\\/p><p>Some \\n    groups have formed themselves into local action projects if they do not \\n    involve many people and work on a small scale. But this form restricts \\n    movement activity to the local level; it cannot be done on the regional or \\n    national. Also, to function well the groups must usually pare themselves \\n    down to that informal group of friends who were running things in the first \\n    place. This excludes many women from participating. As long as the only way \\n    women can participate in the movement is through membership in a small \\n    group, the nongregarious are at a distinct disadvantage. As long as \\n    friendship groups are the main means of organizational activity, elitism \\n    becomes institutionalized.\\n    \\n    \\n\\n<\\/p><p>For \\n    those groups which cannot find a local project to which to devote \\n    themselves, the mere act of staying together becomes the reason for their \\n    staying together. When a group has no specific task (and consciousness<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">-<\\/span>raising is a task), the people in it turn their energies to controlling \\n    others in the group. This is not done so much out of a malicious desire to \\n    manipulate others (though sometimes it is) as out of a lack of anything \\n    better to do with their talents. Able people with time on their hands and a \\n    need to justify their coming together put their efforts into personal \\n    control, and spend their time criticizing the personalities of the other \\n    members in the group. Infighting and personal power games rule the day. When \\n    a group is involved in a task, people learn to get along with others as they \\n    are and to subsume personal dislikes for the sake of the larger goal. There \\n    are limits placed on the compulsion to remold every person in our image of \\n    what they should be.\\n    \\n    \\n\\n<\\/p><p>The \\n    end of consciousness-raising leaves people with no place to go, and the lack \\n    of structure leaves them with no way of getting there. The women the \\n    movement either turn in on themselves and their sisters or seek other \\n    alternatives of action. There are few that are available. Some women just \\n    do their own thing. This can lead to a great deal of individual \\n    creativity, much of which is useful for the movement, but it is not a viable \\n    alternative for most women and certainly does not foster a spirit of \\n    cooperative group effort. Other women drift out of the movement entirely \\n    because they don&rsquo;t want to develop an individual project and they have found \\n    no way of discovering, joining, or starting group projects that interest \\n    them.<\\/p><p>Many \\n    turn to other political organizations to give them the kind of structured, \\n    effective activity that they have not been able to find in the women&rsquo;s \\n    movement. Those political organizations which see women&rsquo;s liberation as only \\n    one of many issues to which women should devote their time thus find the \\n    movement a vast recruiting ground for new members. There is no need for such \\n    organizations to infiltrate (though this is not precluded). The desire for \\n    meaningful political activity generated in women by their becoming part of \\n    the women&rsquo;s liberation movement is sufficient to make them eager to join \\n    other organizations when the movement itself provides no outlets for their \\n    new ideas and energies.<\\/p><p><span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">T<\\/span>hose women who join other political organizations \\n    while remaining within the women&rsquo;s liberation movement, or who join women&rsquo;s \\n    liberation while remaining in other political organizations, in turn become \\n    the framework for new informal structures. These friendship networks are \\n    based upon their common nonfeminist politics rather than the characteristics \\n    discussed earlier, but operate in much the same way. Because these women \\n    share common values, ideas, and political orientations, they too become \\n    informal, unplanned, unselected, unresponsible elites &mdash; whether they intend \\n    to be so or not.\\n\\n<\\/p><p>These \\n    new informal elites are often perceived as threats by the old informal \\n    elites previously developed within different movement groups. This is a \\n    correct perception. Such politically oriented networks are rarely willing to \\n    be merely &ldquo;sororities&rdquo; as many of the old ones were, and want to proselytize \\n    their political as well as their feminist ideas. This is only natural, but \\n    its implications for women&rsquo;s liberation have never been adequately \\n    discussed. The old elites are rarely willing to bring such differences of \\n    opinion out into the open because it would involve exposing the nature of \\n    the informal structure of the group.\\n    \\n    Many \\n    of these informal elites have been hiding under the banner of \\nanti-elitism \\n    and &ldquo;structurelessness.&rdquo; To effectively counter the competition from another \\n    informal structure, they would have to become &ldquo;public,&rdquo; and this possibility \\n    is fraught with many dangerous implications. Thus, to maintain its own \\n    power, it is easier to rationalize the exclusion of the members of the other \\n    informal structure by such means as &ldquo;red-baiting,&rdquo; &ldquo;reformist-baiting,&rdquo; \\n    &ldquo;lesbian-baiting,&rdquo; or &ldquo;straight-baiting.&rdquo; The only other alternative is to \\n    formally structure the group in such a way that the original power structure \\n    is institutionalized. This is not always possible. If the informal elites \\n    have been well structured and have exercised a fair amount of power in the \\n    past, such a task is feasible. These groups have a history of being somewhat \\n    politically effective in the past, as the tightness of the informal \\n    structure has proven an adequate substitute for a formal structure. Becoming \\n    <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s<\\/span>tructured does not alter their operation much, though the \\n    institutionalization of the power structure does open it to formal \\n    challenge. It is those groups which are in greatest need of structure that \\n    are often least capable of creating it. Their informal structures have not \\n    been too well formed and adherence to the ideology of structurelessness \\n    makes them reluctant to change tactics. The more <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">u<\\/span>nstructured a group is, \\n    the more lacking it is in informal structures, and the more it adheres to an \\n    ideology of structurelessness, the more vulnerable it is to being taken \\n    over by a group of political comrades.\\n    \\n    \\n\\n<\\/p><p>Since \\n    the movement at large is just as <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">u<\\/span>nstructured as most of its constituent \\n    groups, it is similarly susceptible to indirect influence. But the \\n    phenomenon manifests itself differently. On a local level most groups can \\n    operate autonomously; but the only groups that can organize a national \\n    activity are nationally organized groups. Thus, it is often the \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s<\\/span>tructured \\n    feminist organizations that provide national direction for feminist \\n    activities, and this direction is determined by the priorities of those \\n    organizations. Such groups as NOW, WEAL, and some leftist women&rsquo;s caucuses \\n    are simply the only organizations capable of mounting a national campaign. \\n    The multitude of <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">u<\\/span>nstructured women&rsquo;s liberation groups can choose to \\n    support or not support the national campaigns, but are incapable of mounting \\n    their own. Thus their members become the troops under the leadership of the \\n    <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s<\\/span>tructured organizations. The avowedly \\n<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">u<\\/span>nstructured group<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\"> has<\\/span> no way of \\n    drawing upon the movement&rsquo;s vast resources to support its priorities. It \\n    doesn&rsquo;t even have a way of deciding what th<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">ose priorities<\\/span> are.\\n\\n<\\/p><p>The \\n    more unstructured a movement i<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">s<\\/span>, the less control it has over the directions \\n    in which it develops and the political actions in which it engages. This \\n    does not mean that its ideas do not spread. Given a certain amount of \\n    interest by the media and the appropriateness of social conditions, the \\n    ideas will still be diffused widely. But diffusion of ideas does not mean \\n    they are implemented; it only means they are talked about. Insofar as they \\n    can be applied individually they may be acted on; insofar as they require \\n    coordinated political power to be implemented, they will not be.\\n    \\n    \\n\\n<\\/p><p><span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">A<\\/span>s \\n    long as the women&rsquo;s liberation movement stays dedicated to a form of \\n    organization which stresses small, inactive discussion groups among friends, \\n    the worst problems of <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">u<\\/span>nstructuredness will not be felt. But this style of \\n    organization has its limits; it is politically inefficacious, exclusive, and \\n    discriminatory against those women who are not or cannot be tied into the \\n    friendship networks. Those who do not fit into what already exists because \\n    of class, race, occupation, education, parental or marital status, \\n    personality, etc., will inevitably be discouraged from trying to \\n    participate. Those who do fit in will develop vested interests in \\n    maintaining things as they are.\\n    \\n    \\n\\n<\\/p><p>The \\n    informal groups&rsquo; vested interests will be sustained by the informal \\n    structures which exist, and the movement will have no way of determining who \\n    shall exercise power within it. If the movement continues deliberately to \\n    not select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish power. All \\n    it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do exercise power and \\n    influence be responsible for it. If the movement continues to keep power as \\n    diffuse as possible because it knows it cannot demand responsibility from \\n    those who have it, it does prevent any group or person from totally \\n    dominating. But it simultaneously <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">e<\\/span>nsures that the movement is as \\n    ineffective as possible. Some middle ground between domination and \\n    ineffectiveness can and must be found.\\n    \\n    \\n\\n<\\/p><p>These \\n    problems are coming to a head at this time because the nature of the \\n    movement is necessarily changing. Consciousness-raising as the main function \\n    of the women&rsquo;s liberation movement is becoming obsolete. Due to the intense \\n    press publicity of the last two years and the numerous overground books and \\n    articles now being circulated, women&rsquo;s liberation has become a household \\n    word. Its issues are discussed and informal rap groups are formed by people \\n    who have no explicit connection with any movement group. The movement must \\n    go on to other tasks. It now needs to establish its priorities, articulate \\n    its goals, and pursue its objectives in a coordinated fashion. To do this it \\n    must get organized &mdash; locally, regionally, and nationally.<\\/p><h3 align=\\\"center\\\"><br>\\nPrinciples of Democratic Structuring <\\/h3>\\n\\n<p>Once \\n    the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of \\n    structurelessness, it is free to develop those forms of organization best \\n    suited to its healthy functioning. This does not mean that we should go to \\n    the other extreme and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organization. \\n    But neither should we blindly reject them all. Some of the traditional \\n    techniques will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights \\n    into what we should and should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal \\n    costs to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment \\n    with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques to \\n    use for different situations. The Lot System is one such idea which has \\n    emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, but is \\n    useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed.

Conversely, if tasks are rotated too \\n            frequently the individual does not have time to learn her job well \\n            and acquire the sense of satisfaction of doing a good job.\\n            \\n            \\n\\n<\\/p><p>5) <i>Allocation<\\/i> of tasks along rational criteria. Selecting \\n            someone for a position because they are liked by the group or giving \\n            them hard work because they are disliked serves neither the group \\n            nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest, and \\n            responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. \\n            People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do not \\n            have, but this is best done through some sort of apprenticeship \\n            program rather than the sink or swimmethod. Having a \\n            responsibility one can&rsquo;t handle well is demoralizing. Conversely, \\n            being blacklisted from doing what one can do well does not encourage \\n            one to develop one&rsquo;s skills. Women have been punished for being \\n            competent throughout most of human history; the movement does not \\n            need to repeat this process.\\n            \\n            \\n\\n<\\/p><p>6) <i>Diffusion of information<\\/i> to everyone as frequently as \\n            possible. Information is power. Access to information enhances one&rsquo;s \\n            power. When an informal network spreads new ideas and information \\n            among themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the \\n            process of forming an opinion &mdash; without the group participating. \\n            The more one knows about how things work and what is happening, the \\n            more politically effective one can be.\\n            \\n            \\n\\n<\\/p><p>7) <i>Equal access to resources<\\/i> needed by the group. This is not always \\nperfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member who maintains a monopoly \\nover a needed resource (like a printing press owned by a husband, or a darkroom) \\ncan unduly influence the use of that resource. Skills and information are also \\nresources. Members&rsquo; skills can be equitably available only when members are \\nwilling to teach what they know to others.\\n\\n<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n\\n<p>When these principles are applied, they <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">e<\\/span>nsure that \\nwhatever structures are developed by different movement groups will be \\ncontrolled by and responsible to the group. The group of people in positions of \\nauthority will be diffuse, flexible, open, and temporary. They will not be in \\nsuch an easy position to institutionalize their power because ultimate decisions \\nwill be made by the group at large, The group will have the power to determine \\nwho shall exercise authority within it.\\n\\n<\\/p><p align=\\\"RIGHT\\\">JO FREEMAN <br>\\n1970 <\\/p>\\n\\n<p align=\\\"RIGHT\\\">&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p align=\\\"left\\\"><br>\\nThis article by Jo Freeman (<span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">a.k.a. <\\/span>\\nJoreen) has been widely reproduced, and\\ndeservedly so. Though originally addressed to the early women&rsquo;s liberation movement,\\nit remains applicable to other areas of radical struggle. I also recommend it to your\\nattention as a fine example of theoretical lucidity and modesty. Notice how thoughtfully\\nFreeman presents the ramifications of this particular issue, setting out the factors that\\npeople need to consider without offering simplistic solutions or indulging in heated\\nrhetoric. This sounds easy, but it is all too rare in the arena of political debate.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p align=\\\"left\\\">These merits can perhaps be appreciated more clearly by noting the\\ncontrast with Cathy Levine&rsquo;s response,\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.libcom.org/library/tyranny-of-tyranny-cathy-levine\\\">The Tyranny of Tyranny<\\/a>.\\nLevine&rsquo;s text may at first seem to present a more radical viewpoint, but if you\\nexamine it carefully I think you will see that it actually does little but evade the\\nissue. Freeman addressed an undeniable problem that was already beginning to be widely\\nrecognized, and drew attention to the important distinction between groups (whether large\\nor small) that have explicit structures and those that have hidden ones. Instead of facing\\nthis problem, Levine drowns it out with <span lang=\\\"en-us\\\">oversimplified <\\/span>platitudes about the evils of large groups and the\\nvirtues of small ones, then goes off on a variety of irrelevant tangential issues. Those\\nissues may be important in other contexts; and Freeman&rsquo;s activities and perspectives\\nmay have been less radical in other regards (see her own\\n of\\nthe period). The point is that at this particular juncture Freeman made an exemplary\\ntheoretical contribution, while Levine&rsquo;s response is a good example of the opposite\\n&mdash; of <em>ideology<\\/em> and the counterproductive role it always serves.<\\/p>\\n\\n<p align=\\\"left\\\">As far as I know, this piece is not copyrighted.

The machine was fast, worked great and was cheap. It has a quad core CPU, 8 gigabytes of Ram with AMD Radeon 7640G graphics that can use up to 4 gigabytes for video processing. (512 MB dedicated called discrete graphics). It played everything I threw at it on high settings with great frame rate such as the new Skyrim, Black Ops 2 and Far Cry 3. All for only 400 US dollars. I could not be happier with my purchase... Then I tried to dual boot Linux and the world came crashing down around me.\\nI knew nothing of UEFI then or Microsoft's requirement of OEM's to use UEFI's Secure Boot feature with Windows 8. Now, I wish I had. Unified Extensible Firmware Interface - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\nUEFI, or EFI is slated to be the replacement for Bios and it's been around for about 20 years. Trouble is, it's buggy and no one wanted to use it. There is good reason why OEM's have dragged their feet for years with this technology. It's still getting the kinks worked out. See here for more: EFI and Linux: the future is here, and it's awful - Matthew Garrett - YouTube\\nSo, I started studying this technology. I found out that what most new consumers have that come shipped with Windows 8 is a bios based system with a UEFI layer implemented, but not always. Some systems have a full UEFI with no Bios and some are UEFI based with a compatibility layer of Bios. Most of the time you wont know which type of system you are buying until it's too late as the OEM's who are Microsoft partners don't advertise this information. One things for certain, if you buy a PC with Windows 8 preinstalled you will have some type of UEFI and you will have Secure Boot enabled.\\nSecure Boot acts as a protection feature that is supposed to ensure your system doesn't have any malware at the time of shipping. It works by checking keys in the operating system against hard coded keys in the UEFI. As these keys are signed by Microsoft, the system will not allow any other operating system to boot assuring you have a clean copy of Windows 8.\\nFor Non ARM based PC's Microsoft requires the user have the ability to disable Secure Boot. Once this is done, Windows 8 will boot normally although still using UEFI for it's IO to the hardware. On many machines you also have the ability to turn off UEFI and boot Windows from Legacy Bios mode.\\nThe problem with dual booting Linux either with UEFI off or Secure Boot disabled is it's not a proven technology that works well even if you do have a distro like Fedora or Ubuntu which supports UEFI and Secure Boot. I spent weeks fighting with getting Linux Mint to work properly in UEFI with Secure Boot disabled getting advise from top professionals - people who know UEFI well enough to write software for it. If the system was installed under UEFI in the first place, you can count on having your share of trouble.\\nI contacted HP's tech support and went round and round trying to explain the issues to people reading scripts off a card and checking with their supervisor with every sentence because they simply lacked the ability to understand the issues. In the end, I was told HP doesn't give support for UEFI, and I should please contact Microsoft.\\nWhich is silly because Microsoft has nothing to do with the bios/UEFI in the machine, they only require it's use. In fact, you will not find one mention about UEFI in any HP documentation - at all. Not on the website, not in the advertising, not in the user Maintenance and Service Guide.\\nI wanted answers. I went over the tech supports heads and spoke to someone (I wont mention her name) who is a: Case Manager for \\\"HP AMS TCO Escalations Team\\\" I'm not exactly sure what that team does but they are supposed to have better answers than tech support. She didn't but told me some interesting things.\\nOne reason all PC's that come preinstalled with a Microsoft operating system is cheaper than regular laptop is that Microsoft subsidizes the cost of the hardware.

They are scratching each others backs there is no other way to put it. The case manager made a point to tell me several times that because Microsoft subsidizes these systems they do not have to allow support for dual booting with a Non Microsoft system or give UEFI support or even provide any documentation on UEFI.\\nWhat's worse in my opinion is she made a point to state proudly they are very interested in Linux. They have several machines certified to work with Linux and they are even Platinum members of The Linux Foundation. It's not about the freedom to use your system as you want, it's about Money. Many people fear Microsoft doing these things knowingly to keep people from dual booting with Windows 8.

It certainly does look like there is something rotten in town and it's not looking good for dual boot users.\\nThe best solution to all of this is if you have such a machine make backup copies of your Recovery Disks, uninstall the system completely, and reinstall in Legacy Bios mode. You don't really need UEFI at this stage unless you have a hard drive larger than 2.2 TB's. If you want to do a clean non OEM bundled install you may be able to obtain a Windows 8 ISO from torrent of the disks here: MSDN Subscriber Downloads ( You will still have to re-install all your drivers manually) You cannot download from this site directly if you are not a MSDN partner but if you obtain such a disk you can legally use it because the product keys and CD keys are embedded in the systems bios. This will be true for all OEM machines that come preshipped with Windows 8. The installation disk will check your keys and activate your Windows as legal on first boot. In HP's case, this also will not void the warranty, your OEM may be different.\\nBottom line, if you plan to dual boot with Linux, don't buy a Windows 8 preinstalled machine or be prepared for headaches. Better yet, don't support these companies at all who have these shady business practices. Buy from a company who doesn't partner with Microsoft or build your own machine.

 "{\"text\":\"Weather permitting, millions of people in the northeastern USA could witness a rare and eerie sight next week: a space rock blotting out one of the brightest stars in the sky.\\nThe Rhode Island-sized space rock will extinguish the light from the star Regulus just after 2 a.m. ET Thursday for as long as 14 seconds. This blockage-by-space rock will be the most visible such event in North America, an unprecedented marvel that those with no astronomical knowledge can observe.\\nWhats more, anyone with even modest gear can contribute real science, says Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at magazine. You can give one additional data point for determining the character of this asteroid that will be known for all time and history. An observer armed with a digital SLR camera can collect high-quality data, but even someone with just a stopwatch, video camera or no equipment at all can provide useful information.\\nSpace rocks, formally known as asteroids, block the stars every night. Only people with telescopes can see most of these occultations. The asteroid is usually too small, too dim, too fast or too far away to make for easy observation, and relatively few stars are bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, says Steve Preston, president of the International Occultation Timing Association, a volunteer science organization, via e-mail. He says that since the 1980s, only eight occultations of stars visible to the naked eye have been observed in the USA. The asteroid blockage of the next-brightest star was in 1975, and that star was far dimmer than the star that will vanish next week.\\nThe star of the show Thursday is Regulus in the constellation Leo, which will be in the western part of the sky in the wee hours. Regulus is whats known as a first-magnitude star, so its very bright to those in rural areas and visible in big cities except in places such as Times Square that are drenched in artificial light.\\nThanks to Regulus brightness, the asteroids passage will be visible in New York City, Long Island and portions of New York state, New Jersey, Connecticut and eastern Canada. The exact time will vary by location, but those in the New York metropolitan area should see the star disappear around 2:06 a.m. ET, according to the website set up by the occultation association.\\nOf all the occultations easily visible to lots of people, this is going to be by far the best one, head and shoulders above any other, says Brad Timerson, another official of the occultation association. Of course, its 2 oclock on a Thursday morning.\\nThe spoiler that will temporarily hide Regulus light is a 45-mile-wide rock named Erigone. Erigone, which is as dark as fresh asphalt, orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter and does not come close to Earth, says Jos\u00e9 Luis Galache, an astronomer at the Minor Planet Center, which tracks comets, asteroids and other small objects. Observers should see the star wink out, then reappear. Anyone who times the event can send observations to the occultation association (http://occultations.org/regulus2014), which will use the collected data to calculate the asteroids shape and precise size and to learn more about Regulus itself.\\nSkywatchers from as far away as Germany plan to descend on New York for the asteroids passage, and astronomers plan to deploy to bars in Brooklyn and Manhattan to encourage late-night patrons to step outside. The occultation association has developed a free smartphone app to help people time the passage of the asteroid.

This blockage-by-space rock will be the most visible such event in North America, an unprecedented marvel that those with no astronomical knowledge can observe.<\\/p><p>What\\u0092s more, anyone with even modest gear \\u0093can contribute real science,\\u0094 says Alan MacRobert, a senior editor at  magazine. \\u0093You can give one additional data point for determining the character of this asteroid that will be known for all time and history.\\u0094 An observer armed with a digital SLR camera can collect high-quality data, but even someone with just a stopwatch, video camera or no equipment at all can provide useful information.<\\/p><p>Space rocks, formally known as asteroids, block the stars every night. Only people with telescopes can see most of these \\u0093occultations.\\u0094 The asteroid is usually too small, too dim, too fast or too far away to make for easy observation, and relatively few stars are bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, says Steve Preston, president of the International Occultation Timing Association, a volunteer science organization, via e-mail. He says that since the 1980s, only eight occultations of stars visible to the naked eye have been observed in the USA. The asteroid blockage of the next-brightest star was in 1975, and that star was far dimmer than the star that will vanish next week.<\\/p><p>The star of the show Thursday is Regulus in the constellation Leo, which will be in the western part of the sky in the wee hours. Regulus is what\\u0092s known as a first-magnitude star, so it\\u0092s very bright to those in rural areas and visible in big cities except in places such as Times Square that are drenched in artificial light.<\\/p><p>Thanks to Regulus\\u0092 brightness, the asteroid\\u0092s passage will be visible in New York City, Long Island and portions of New York state, New Jersey, Connecticut and eastern Canada. The exact time will vary by location, but those in the New York metropolitan area should see the star disappear around 2:06 a.m. ET, according to the website set up by the occultation association.<\\/p><p>Of all the occultations \\u0093easily visible to lots of people, this is going to be by far the best one, head and shoulders above any other,\\u0094 says Brad Timerson, another official of the occultation association. \\u0093Of course, it\\u0092s 2 o\\u0092clock on a Thursday morning.\\u0094<\\/p><p>The spoiler that will temporarily hide Regulus\\u0092 light is a 45-mile-wide rock named Erigone. Erigone, which is as dark as fresh asphalt, orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter and does not come close to Earth, says Jos&eacute; Luis Galache, an astronomer at the Minor Planet Center, which tracks comets, asteroids and other small objects. Observers should see the star wink out, then reappear. Anyone who times the event can send observations to the occultation association (<a href=\\\"http://occultations.org/regulus2014\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://occultations.org/regulus2014<\\/a>), which will use the collected data to calculate the asteroid\\u0092s shape and precise size and to learn more about Regulus itself.<\\/p><p>Skywatchers from as far away as Germany plan to descend on New York for the asteroid\\u0092s passage, and astronomers plan to deploy to bars in Brooklyn and Manhattan to encourage late-night patrons to step outside. The occultation association has developed a free smartphone app to help people time the passage of the asteroid. The group will post recommendations about the locations most likely to have clear skies.<\\/p><p>The long-term forecast for early Thursday is for clouds, but unless the forecast is \\u0093hopeless,\\u0094 Preston says, he\\u0092ll fly from his home in Seattle to New York in hopes of seeing the spectacle.<\\/p><p>\\u0093This is a very rare event,\\u0094 he says.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://www.pvk.ca/favicon.png\",\"author\":\"Paul Khuong\",\"text\":\"EDIT: Lutz Euler points out that the NEXT sequence (used to) encode an effective address with an index register but no base. The mistake doesn\\u2019t affect the meaning of the instruction, but forces a wasteful encoding. The difference in machine code are as follows.\\nBefore (14 bytes):\\nNow (9 bytes):\\nI fixed the definition of NEXT, but not the disassembly snippets below; they still show the old machine code.\\nEarlier this week, I took another look at the F18. As usual with Chuck Moore\\u2019s work, it\\u2019s hard to tell the difference between insanity and mere brilliance ;) One thing that struck me is how small the stack is: 10 slots, with no fancy overflow/underflow trap. The rationale is that, if you need more slots, you\\u2019re doing it wrong, and that silent overflow is useful when you know what you\\u2019re doing. That certainly jibes with my experience on the HP-41C and with x87. It also reminds me of a post of djb\\u2019s decrying our misuse of x87\\u2019s rotating stack: his thesis was that, with careful scheduling, a \\u201cfree\\u201d FXCH makes the stack equivalent \\u2013 if not superior \\u2013 to registers. The post ends with a (non-pipelined) loop that wastes no cycle on shuffling data, thanks to the x87\\u2019s implicit stack rotation.\\nThat lead me to wonder what implementation techniques become available for stack-based VMs that restrict their stack to, e.g., 8 slots. Obviously, it would be ideal to keep everything in registers. However, if we do that na\u00efvely, push and pop become a lot more complicated; there\\u2019s a reason why Forth engines usually cache only the top 1-2 elements of the stack.\\nI decided to mimic the x87 and the F18 (EDIT: modulo the latter\\u2019s two TOS cache registers): pushing/popping doesn\\u2019t cause any data movement. Instead, like the drawing below shows, they decrement/increment a modular counter that points to the top of the stack (TOS). That would still be slow in software (most ISAs can\\u2019t index registers). The key is that the counter can\\u2019t take too many values: only 8 values if there are 8 slots in the stack. Stack VMs already duplicate primops for performance reasons (e.g., to help the BTB by spreading out execution of the same primitive between multiple addresses), so it seems reasonable to specialise primitives for all 8 values the stack counter can take.\\nIn a regular direct threaded VM, most primops would end with a code sequence that jumps to the next one (NEXT), something like\\nadd rsi, 8 ; increment virtual IP before jumping jmp [rsi-8] ; jump to the address RSI previously pointed to\\nwhere rsi is the virtual instruction pointer, and VM instructions are simply pointers to the machine code for the relevant primitive.\\nI\\u2019ll make two changes to this sequence. I don\\u2019t like hardcoding addresses in bytecode, and 64 bits per virtual instruction is overly wasteful. Instead, I\\u2019ll encode offsets from the primop code block:\\nmov eax, [rsi] add rsi, 4 add rax, rdi jmp rax\\nwhere rdi is the base address for primops.\\nI also need to dispatch based on the new value of the implicit stack counter. I decided to make the dispatch as easy as possible by storing the variants of each primop at regular intervals (e.g. one page). I rounded that up to 64 * 67 = 4288 bytes to minimise aliasing accidents. NEXT becomes something like\\nmov eax, [rsi] add rsi, 4 lea rax, [rax + rdi + variant_offset] jmp rax\\nThe trick is that variant_offset = 4288 * stack_counter, and the stack counter is (usually) known when the primitive is compiled. If the stack is left as is, so is the counter; pushing a value decrements the counter and popping one increments it.\\nThat seems reasonable enough. Let\\u2019s see if we can make it work.\\nI want to explore a problem for which I\\u2019ll emit a lot of repetitive machine code. SLIME\\u2019s REPL and SBCL\\u2019s assembler are perfect for the task! (I hope it\\u2019s clear that I\\u2019m using unsupported internals; if it breaks, you keep the pieces.)\\nThe basic design of the VM is:\\nr8-r15: stack slots (32 bits);\\nrsi: base address for machine code primitives;\\nrdi: virtual instruction pointer (points to the next instruction);\\nrax,rbx,rcx,rdx: scratch registers;\\nrsp: (virtual) return stack pointer.\\nThe idea is that we\\u2019ll define functions to emit assembly code for each primitive; these functions will be implicitly parameterised on *stack-pointer* thanks to @. We can then call them as many times as needed to cover all values of *stack-pointer*. The only complication is that code sequences will differ in length, so we must insert padding to keep everything in sync. That\\u2019s what emit-code does:\\nThis function is used by emit-all-code to emit the machine code for a bunch of primitives, while tracking the start offset for each primitive.\\nNow, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance:\\nLet\\u2019s add a few simple primitives.\\nThe code for swap lives between bytes 0 and 32. Let\\u2019s take a look at the version for *stack-pointer* = 0 and *stack-pointer* = 1.\\ndup is at 32-64, and sub at 128-152:\\nThese are relatively tight. I certainly like how little data shuffling there is; the NEXT sequence is a bit hairy, but the indirect branch is likely its weakest (and least avoidable) point.\\nA VM without control flow isn\\u2019t even a toy. First, unconditional relative jumps. These can be encoded as [jmp] [offset], with the 32 bit offset relative to the end of offset. We just overwrite *virtual-ip* with the new address.\\nCall and return are at the heart of Forth-like engines. ret is easy: just pop from the control stack into *virtual-ip*.\\nCall is a bit more complicated. It\\u2019s like jmp, but pushes the address of the next instruction to the control stack:\\nLet\\u2019s look at the resulting machine code.\\nWe finally almost have enough for interesting demos. The only important thing that\\u2019s still missing is calls from CL into the VM. I\\u2019ll assume that the caller takes care of saving any important register, and that the primop (rsi) and virtual IP (rdi) registers are setup correctly. The stack will be filled on entry, by copying values from the buffer rax points to, and written back on exit.\\nThe CL-side interlocutor of enter follows, as a VOP:\\nThe only thing missing is to store the machine code for our primop in a range of memory that\\u2019s executable.\\nLet\\u2019s execute add sub (and finish with leave).\\nAnd, indeed, 10 - (3 + 2) = 5.\\nWe should also test function calls\\nInstead of executing add directly, this bytecode sequence calls to whatever is 8 bytes (2 dwords) after the call instruction; in our case, add ret.\\nWriting bytecode by hand is annoying. This tiny functions takes care of the stupid stuff.\\nWe can now write\\nWe can now either write (basically) straightline code or infinite loops. We need conditionals. Their implementation is much like jmp, with a tiny twist. Let\\u2019s start with jump if (top of stack is) non-zero and jump if zero.\\nIt\\u2019s hard to write programs without immediate values. Earlier control flow primitives already encode immediate data in the virtual instruction stream. We\\u2019ll do the same for lit, inc, and dec:\\nFinally, we have enough for a decent-looking (if useless) loop. First, update the primop code page:\\nOne million iterations of this stupid loop that only decrements a counter took 15M cycles. 15 cycles/iteration really isn\\u2019t that bad\\u2026 especially considering that it executes an indirect jump after loading 1, after subtracting, and after comparing with 0.\\nWe can do better by fusing lit sub into dec:\\nDecrementing a counter and jumping if non zero is a common operation (old x86 even implemented that in hardware, with loop). Let\\u2019s add decrement and jump if non-zero (djn) to the VM:\\nThat\\u2019s better\\u2026 But I\\u2019m really not convinced by the conditional move. The branch will usually be predictable, so it makes sense to expose that to the hardware and duplicate the NEXT sequence.\\nThe resulting code isn\\u2019t too large, and the two indirect jumps are 16 bytes apart.\\nThis alternative implementation does work better on our stupid loop.\\nLet\\u2019s see how that compares to straight assembly code.\\nMy slow macbook air gets 1 iteration/cycle on a loop that\\u2019s 100% control overhead. With djn2, a good implementation of a reasonable specialised operator, the loop is about 6x as slow as native code. A worse implementation of djn is still only 8x as slow as pure native code, and horribly unspecialised bytecode is 11-15x as slow as native code.\\nSpecialising primops to a virtual stack pointer is feasible in practice, when the stack is restricted to a small size. It also seems to have a reasonable runtime overhead for threaded interpreters. I\\u2019m not actually interested in straight stack languages; however, I believe that a fixed stack VM makes a nice runtime IR, when coupled with a mechanism for local variables. We\\u2019ll see if I find time to translate a high level language into superoperators for such a VM. Fused operators would reduce the importance of NEXT; in constrast, simpler function calls (because there\\u2019s less shuffling of items to stack them up in the right position) would remain as useful.\\nSBCL has definitely proven itself to be a good companion to explore the generation of domain-specific machine code. I don\\u2019t know of any other language implementation with that kind of support for interactive programming and machine code generation (and inspection). FWIW, I believe LuaJIT + dynasm will soon be comparable.\\nSteel Bank Common Lisp: because sometimes C abstracts away too much ;)\",\"title\":\"SBCL: The Ultimate Assembly Code Breadboard\",\"images\":[{\"primary\":\"true\",\"url\":\"http://www.pvk.ca/images/2014-03-15-sbcl-the-ultimate-assembly-code-breadboard/rotating-stack.jpg\"}],\"html\":\"<div><p><em>EDIT: Lutz Euler points out that the <code>NEXT<\\/code> sequence (used to) encode\\nan effective address with an index register but no base.

So, if nobody loves politics, why all the politics?\\nPolitical behavior almost always starts with the CEO. Now you may be thinking: \\u201cI hate politics, I\\u2019m not political, but my organization is very political. I clearly didn\\u2019t cause this.\\u201d Sadly, you needn\\u2019t be political to create extreme political behavior in your organization. In fact, it\\u2019s often the least political CEOs who run the most ferociously political organizations. Apolitical CEOs frequently accidentally encourage intense political behavior.\\nWhat do I mean by politics? I mean people advancing their careers or agendas by means other than merit and contribution. There may be other types of politics, but politics of this form seem to be the ones that really bother people.\\nHow it happens\\nA CEO creates politics by encouraging and sometimes incenting political behavior\\u2014often accidentally. For a very simple example, let\\u2019s consider executive compensation. As CEO, senior employees will come to you from time to time and ask for an increase in compensation. They may suggest that you are paying them far less than their current market value. They may even have a competitive offer in hand. Faced with this confrontation, if the request is reasonable, you might investigate the situation. You might even give the employee a raise. This may sound innocent, but you have just created a strong incentive for political behavior.\\nSpecifically, you will be rewarding behavior that has nothing to do with advancing your business. The employee will earn a raise by asking for one rather than you automatically rewarding them for outstanding performance. Why is this bad? Let me count the ways:\\nThe other ambitious members of your staff will immediately agitate for raises as well. Note that neither this campaign nor the prior one need be correlated with actual performance. You will now spend time dealing with the political issues rather than actual performance issues. Importantly, if you have a competent board, you will not be able to give them all out-of-cycle raises, so your company executive raises will occur on a first-come, first-serve basis.\\nThe less aggressive (but perhaps more competent) members of your team will be denied off-cycle raises simply by being apolitical.\\nThe object lesson for your staff and the company will be the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the political employee gets the raise. Get ready for a whole lot of squeaky wheels.\\nNow let\\u2019s move on to a more complicated example. Your CFO comes to you and says that he wants to continue developing as a manager. He says that he would like to eventually become a COO and would like to know what skills he must demonstrate in order to earn that position in your company. Being a positive leader, you would like to encourage him to pursue his dream. You tell him that you think that he\\u2019d be a fine COO some day and that he should work to develop a few more skills. In addition, you tell him that he\\u2019ll need to be a strong enough leader, such that other executives in the company will want to work for him. A week later, one of your other executives comes to you in a panic. She says that the CFO just asked her if she\\u2019d work for him. She says that he said that you are grooming him to be the COO and that\\u2019s his final step. Did that just happen? Welcome to the big time.\\nHow to minimize politics\\nProfessionals vs. Amateurs\\nMinimizing politics often feels totally unnatural. It\\u2019s counter to excellent management practices such as being open minded and encouraging employee development.\\nThe difference between managing executives and managing more junior employees can be thought of as the difference between being in a fight with someone with no training and being in a ring with a professional boxer. If you are in a fight with a regular person, then you can do natural things and they won\\u2019t get you into much trouble. For example, if you want to take a step backwards, you can pick your front foot up first. If you do this against a professional boxer, you will get your block knocked off. Professional boxers train for years to take advantage of small errors in technique. Lifting your front foot first to take a step backwards will take you slightly off balance for a split second and that\\u2019s all your opponent will need.\\nSimilarly, if you manage a junior employee and they ask you about their career development, you can say what comes naturally and generally get away with it. As we saw above, things change when you deal with highly ambitious, seasoned professionals. In order to keep from getting knocked out by corporate politics, you need to refine your technique.\\nThe Technique\\nAs I developed as a CEO, I found three key techniques to be extremely useful in minimizing politics.\\n1. Hire people with the right kind of ambition\\u2014The cases that I described above might involve people who are ambitious, but not necessarily inherently political. All cases are not like this. The surest way to turn your company into the political equivalent of the US Senate is to hire people with the wrong kind of ambition. As defined by Andy Grove, the right kind of ambition is ambition for the company\\u2019s success with the executive\\u2019s own success only coming as a by-product of the company\\u2019s victory. The wrong kind of ambition is ambition for the executive\\u2019s personal success regardless of the company\\u2019s outcome.\\n2. Build strict processes for potentially political issues and do not deviate\\u2014Certain activities attract political behavior. These activities include:\\nPerformance evaluation and compensation\\nOrganizational design and territory\\nPromotions\\nLet\\u2019s examine each case and how you might build and execute a process that insulates the company from bad behavior and politically motivated outcomes.\\nPerformance and compensation\\u2014Often companies defer putting performance management and compensation processes in place. This doesn\\u2019t mean that they don\\u2019t evaluate employees or give pay raises; it just means they do so in an ad hoc manner that\\u2019s highly vulnerable to political machinations. By conducting well-structured, regular performance and compensation reviews, you will ensure that pay and stock increases are as fair as possible. This is especially important for executive compensation as doing so will also serve to minimize politics. In the example above, the CEO should have had an airtight performance and compensation policy and simply told the executive that his compensation would be evaluated with everyone else\\u2019s. Ideally, the executive compensation process should involve the board of directors. This will a) help ensure good governance and b) make exceptions even more difficult.\\nOrganizational design and territory\\u2014If you manage ambitious people, from time to time, they will want to expand their scope of responsibility. In the example above, the CFO wanted to become the COO. In other situations, the head of marketing might want to run sales and marketing or the head of engineering may want to run engineering and product management. When someone raises an issue like this with you, you must be very careful about what you say, because everything that you say can be turned into political cannon fodder. Generally, it\\u2019s best to say nothing at all. At most, you might ask \\u201cwhy?\\u201d, but if you do so be sure not to react to the reasons. If you indicate what you are thinking, that information will leak, rumors will spread and you plant the seeds for all kinds of unproductive discussions. You should evaluate your organizational design on a regular basis and gather the information that you need to decide without tipping people to what you plan to do. Once you decide, you should immediately execute the re-org: don\\u2019t leave time for leaks and lobbying.\\nPromotions\\u2014Every time your company gives someone a promotion, everyone else at that person\\u2019s level evaluates the promotion and judges whether merit or political favors yielded the promotion. If the latter, then the other employees generally react in one of three ways:\\nThey sulk and feel undervalued\\nThey outwardly disagree, campaign against the person, and undermine them in their new position\\nThey attempt to copy the political behavior that generated the unwarranted promotion\\nClearly, you don\\u2019t want any of these behaviors in your company. Therefore, you must have a formal, visible, defensible promotion process that governs every employee promotion. Often this process must be different for people on your own staff (the general process may involve various managers who are familiar with the employee\\u2019s work, the executive process should include the board of directors). The purpose of the process is twofold. First, it will give the organization confidence that the company at least attempted to base the promotion on merit and second, the result of the process will be the information necessary for your team to explain the promotion decisions that you made.\\n3. Be careful with \\u201che said, she said\\u201d\\u2014Once your organization grows to a significant size, members of your team will, from time to time, complain about each other. Sometimes this criticism will be extremely aggressive. Be very careful about how you listen and the message that it sends. Simply by hearing them out without defending the employee in question, you will send the message that you agree. If people in the company think that you agree that one of your executives is less than stellar, that information will spread quickly and without qualification. As a result, people will stop listening to the executive in question and they will soon become ineffective.\\nThere are two distinct types of complaints that you will receive:\\nComplaints about an executive\\u2019s behavior\\nComplaints about an executive\\u2019s competency or performance\\nGenerally, the best way to handle complaints of type 1 is to get the complaining executive and the targeted executive in the room together and have them explain themselves. Usually, simply having this meeting will resolve the conflict and correct the behavior (if it was actually broken). Do not attempt to address behavioral issues without both executives in the room. Doing so will invite manipulation and politics.\\nComplaints of type 2 are both more rare and more complex. If one of your executives summons the courage to complain about the competency of one of their peers, then there is a good chance that either the complainer or the targeted executive has a major problem. If you receive a type 2 complaint, you will generally have one of two reactions: a) they will be telling you something that you already know or b) they\\u2019ll be telling you shocking news.\\nIf they are telling you something that you already know, then the big news is that you have let the situation go too far. Whatever your reasons for attempting to rehabilitate the wayward executive, you have taken too long and now your organization has turned on the executive in question. You must resolve the situation quickly. Almost always, this means firing the executive. While I\\u2019ve seen executives improve their performance and skill sets, I\\u2019ve never seen one lose the support of the organization then regain it.\\nOn the other hand, if the complaint is new news, then you must immediately stop the conversation and make clear to the complaining executive that you in no way agree with their assessment. You do not want to cripple the other executive before you re-evaluate their performance. You do not want the complaint to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once you\\u2019ve shut down the conversation, you must quickly re-assess the employee in question. If you find that they are doing an excellent job, then you must figure out the complaining executive\\u2019s motivations and resolve them. Do not let an accusation of this magnitude fester. If you find that the employee is doing a poor job, there will be time to go back and get the complaining employee\\u2019s input, but you should be on a track to remove the poor performer at that point.\\nClosing Thought\\nAs CEO, you must consider the systemic incentives that result from your words and actions. While it may feel good in the moment to be open, responsive and action oriented, be careful not to encourage all the wrong things.\",\"title\":\"How to Minimize Politics in Your Company\",\"html\":\"<div class=\\\"content-pages-show-blog-post\\\">\\n      \\n\\n  \\n\\n<div id=\\\"content\\\">\\n\\n  <div class=\\\"intro\\\" id=\\\"intro\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"content\\\">\\n      \\n<p>In all my years in business, I have yet to hear someone say: &ldquo;I love corporate politics.&rdquo; On the other hand, I meet plenty of people who complain bitterly about corporate politics&mdash;sometimes even in the companies they run. So, if nobody loves politics, why all the politics?<\\/p><p>Political behavior almost always starts with the CEO. Now you may be thinking: &ldquo;I hate politics, I&rsquo;m not political, but my organization is very political. I clearly didn&rsquo;t cause this.&rdquo; Sadly, you needn&rsquo;t be political to create extreme political behavior in your organization. In fact, it&rsquo;s often the least political CEOs who run the most ferociously political organizations. Apolitical CEOs frequently accidentally encourage intense political behavior.<\\/p><p>What do I mean by <em>politics<\\/em>? <em>I mean people advancing their careers or agendas by means other than merit and contribution<\\/em>. There may be other types of politics, but politics of this form seem to be the ones that really bother people.<\\/p>\\n<h2>How it happens<\\/h2>\\n<p>A CEO creates politics by encouraging and sometimes incenting political behavior&mdash;often accidentally. For a very simple example, let&rsquo;s consider executive compensation. As CEO, senior employees will come to you from time to time and ask for an increase in compensation. They may suggest that you are paying them far less than their current market value. They may even have a competitive offer in hand. Faced with this confrontation, if the request is reasonable, you might investigate the situation. You might even give the employee a raise. This may sound innocent, but you have just created a strong incentive for political behavior.<\\/p><p>Specifically, you will be rewarding behavior that has nothing to do with advancing your business. The employee will earn a raise by asking for one rather than you automatically rewarding them for outstanding performance. Why is this bad? Let me count the ways:<\\/p>\\n<ol><ol>\\n<li>The other ambitious members of your staff will immediately agitate for raises as well. Note that neither this campaign nor the prior one need be correlated with actual performance. You will now spend time dealing with the political issues rather than actual performance issues. Importantly, if you have a competent board, you will not be able to give them all out-of-cycle raises, so your company executive raises will occur on a first-come, first-serve basis.<br><br>\\n<\\/li>\\n<li>The less aggressive (but perhaps more competent) members of your team will be denied off-cycle raises simply by being apolitical.<br><br>\\n<\\/li>\\n<li>The object lesson for your staff and the company will be the <em>squeaky wheel gets the grease and the political employee gets the raise<\\/em>. Get ready for a whole lot of squeaky wheels.<\\/li>\\n<\\/ol><\\/ol><p>Now let&rsquo;s move on to a more complicated example. Your CFO comes to you and says that he wants to continue developing as a manager. He says that he would like to eventually become a COO and would like to know what skills he must demonstrate in order to earn that position in <em>your<\\/em> company. Being a positive leader, you would like to encourage him to pursue his dream. You tell him that you think that he&rsquo;d be a fine COO some day and that he should work to develop a few more skills. In addition, you tell him that he&rsquo;ll need to be a strong enough leader, such that other executives in the company will want to work for him. A week later, one of your other executives comes to you in a panic. She says that the CFO just asked her if she&rsquo;d work for him. She says that he said that you are grooming him to be the COO and that&rsquo;s his final step. Did that just happen? Welcome to the big time.<\\/p>\\n<h2>How to minimize politics<\\/h2>\\n<h3>Professionals vs. Amateurs<\\/h3>\\n<p>Minimizing politics often feels totally unnatural. It&rsquo;s counter to excellent management practices such as being open minded and encouraging employee development.<\\/p><p>The difference between managing executives and managing more junior employees can be thought of as the difference between being in a fight with someone with no training and being in a ring with a professional boxer. If you are in a fight with a regular person, then you can do natural things and they won&rsquo;t get you into much trouble. For example, if you want to take a step backwards, you can pick your front foot up first. If you do this against a professional boxer, you will get your block knocked off. Professional boxers train for years to take advantage of small errors in technique. Lifting your front foot first to take a step backwards will take you slightly off balance for a split second and that&rsquo;s all your opponent will need.<\\/p><p>Similarly, if you manage a junior employee and they ask you about their career development, you can say what comes naturally and generally get away with it. As we saw above, things change when you deal with highly ambitious, seasoned professionals. In order to keep from getting knocked out by corporate politics, you need to refine your technique.<\\/p>\\n<h3>The Technique<\\/h3>\\n<p>As I developed as a CEO, I found three key techniques to be extremely useful in minimizing politics.<\\/p><p><strong>1. Hire people with the right kind of ambition<\\/strong><em>&mdash;<\\/em>The cases that I described above might involve people who are ambitious, but not necessarily inherently political. All cases are not like this. The surest way to turn your company into the political equivalent of the US Senate is to hire people with the wrong kind of ambition. As defined by Andy Grove, the right kind of ambition is ambition for the company&rsquo;s success with the executive&rsquo;s own success only coming as a by-product of the company&rsquo;s victory. The wrong kind of ambition is ambition for the executive&rsquo;s personal success regardless of the company&rsquo;s outcome.<\\/p><p><strong>2. Build strict processes for potentially political issues and do not deviate<\\/strong>&mdash;Certain activities attract political behavior. These activities include:<\\/p>\\n<ul><ul>\\n<li>Performance evaluation and compensation<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul><\\/ul><ul><ul>\\n<li>Organizational design and territory<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul><\\/ul><ul><ul>\\n<li>Promotions<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul><\\/ul><p>Let&rsquo;s examine each case and how you might build and execute a process that insulates the company from bad behavior and politically motivated outcomes.<\\/p><p><em>Performance and compensation&mdash;<\\/em>Often companies defer putting performance management and compensation processes in place. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that they don&rsquo;t evaluate employees or give pay raises; it just means they do so in an ad hoc manner that&rsquo;s highly vulnerable to political machinations. By conducting well-structured, regular performance and compensation reviews, you will ensure that pay and stock increases are as fair as possible. This is especially important for executive compensation as doing so will also serve to minimize politics. In the example above, the CEO should have had an airtight performance and compensation policy and simply told the executive that his compensation would be evaluated with everyone else&rsquo;s. Ideally, the executive compensation process should involve the board of directors. This will a) help ensure good governance and b) make exceptions even more difficult.<\\/p><p><em>Organizational design and territory<\\/em>&mdash;If you manage ambitious people, from time to time, they will want to expand their scope of responsibility. In the example above, the CFO wanted to become the COO. In other situations, the head of marketing might want to run sales and marketing or the head of engineering may want to run engineering and product management. When someone raises an issue like this with you, you must be very careful about what you say, because everything that you say can be turned into political cannon fodder. Generally, it&rsquo;s best to say nothing at all. At most, you might ask &ldquo;why?&rdquo;, but if you do so be sure not to react to the reasons.

Once you decide, you should immediately execute the re-org: don&rsquo;t leave time for leaks and lobbying.<\\/p><p><em>Promotions<\\/em>&mdash;Every time your company gives someone a promotion, everyone else at that person&rsquo;s level evaluates the promotion and judges whether merit or political favors yielded the promotion. If the latter, then the other employees generally react in one of three ways:<\\/p>\\n<ol><ol>\\n<li>They sulk and feel undervalued<br><br>\\n<\\/li>\\n<li>They outwardly disagree, campaign against the person, and undermine them in their new position<br><br>\\n<\\/li>\\n<li>They attempt to copy the political behavior that generated the unwarranted promotion<\\/li>\\n<\\/ol><\\/ol><p>Clearly, you don&rsquo;t want any of these behaviors in your company.

As of January 2014, 123616 .bit domains have been registered.[1][2][6][9][10] bit domains are not currently awarded, hence to resolve domain names, one must have either a copy of the Namecoin \\\"block chain\\\" (a decentralized ledger storing all transactions and domains), or access to a public DNS server that participates in the Namecoin system.[1][11]\\nA Namecoin like system was first described in 2010, with ideas such as BitDNS by Appamato, and then by internet activistAaron Swartz, as a counterexample to Zooko's triangle.[8][12][13] A few months later on April 18, 2011, it was implemented as Namecoin (which at the time had no GUI).[14][15][16] In June 2011, Wikileaks publicly endorsed Namecoin.[14][17] In September 2011, Namecoin switched to merged mining (see the mining section). In 2013, GUIs, such as Namecoin began to appear; as of November 5, the latest version of Namecoin Qt is version 0.3.72.[18] February 5th, 2014, a Windows/Linux Firefox plug-in called FreeSpeechMe was released that allows automated resolution of .bit addresses by downloading the Namecoin block chain and running it in the background. March 7th, 2014 a Windows system-wide Dot-Bit program called MeowBit was released.\\nUses\\nAlthough Namecoin can be used as a currency, it is mainly intended to be used as a decentralized DNS.[1][2][6] are registered by paying a small fee (to stop spam and leave domains for future users) of 0.01 NMC, they are then updated for the first time, after this the person owns the domain, which can only be removed from them if they choose to transfer it.[1][6][19] Domain names must be updated every 250 days, or they will expire.[1]\\nThere are also other possible Namecoin uses including:\\n/timestamp system (note that this is not unique to Namecoin, other cryptocurrencies could implement this too)[20]\\nPublic file checksum, which would be used to ensure integrity of files, they would be stored on the Namecoin network to ensure the checksum itself couldn't be tampered with.[22]\\nNamecoin production and transfer is handled by a peer-to-peer network similar to that of Bitcoin.[6] A proof-of-work system is used, where nodes search for a small enough hash (SHA-256) value in a process called mining.[6] When a small enough value is found, the node which found the hash is credited with a set number of Namecoins (50 NMC as of Nov 2013), and the hash, along with any transactions or domain name registrations, is added to a decentralized ledger called the block chain.[1] After several subsequent hashes have been added onto the block chain, transactions and registrations are considered to be irreversible, as an attacker would have to find a new set of hashes to replace all the preceding ones (this would require an infeasible amount of computing power).\\nNamecoin is merge mined with Bitcoin, which means that a node can mine for both Namecoin and Bitcoin simultaneously at the same rate that they would mine just one.[11][19][29][30]\\nPayments in Namecoin are made to addresses (based on digital signatures). Addresses are human readable strings of 33 numbers beginning with the letters N or M (they used to start with 1, like Bitcoin, but this was changed to avoid confusion).[31] This makes Namecoin pseudonymous, but not anonymous.[32][33]\\nNamecoin can be traded for other currencies through various online exchanges. Some exchanges are: Vircurex, Lilion Transfer, , cryptonit, Poloniex, bter.com, BTC-E, and 24change.\\nSince domains are extremely cheap to obtain with Namecoin, and registered domains cannot be seized (they can only be transferred by their owner), Namecoin has had problems with cybersquatters buying up domains, hoping to resell them later for a profit.[2]\\nOn October 15, 2013, a major flaw in the namecoin protocol was revealed by the exchange COO, Michael Gr\u00f8nager. The exploit allowed any user to freely steal any domain from any other user.[34] A temporary fix was deployed which prevents fraudulent name transactions from affecting the name database without requiring miner intervention, and a long-term fix which rejects blocks containing such transactions is scheduled for block 150,000 if a majority of miners upgrade.[35]\\nThe Namecoin source code has only been forked once into a publicly released altcoin, Huntercoin.\",\"title\":\"Namecoin\",\"images\":[{\"primary\":\"true\",\"url\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Namecoin_Qt_Version_0.3.64_Manage_Names_Tab.png/170px-Namecoin_Qt_Version_0.3.64_Manage_Names_Tab.png\"},{\"url\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Namecoin_Qt_Version_0.3.64_Overview_Tab.png/220px-Namecoin_Qt_Version_0.3.64_Overview_Tab.png\"}],\"html\":\"<div><div class=\\\"mw-body\\\" id=\\\"content\\\" role=\\\"main\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<a id=\\\"top\\\"><\\/a>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\\"mw-js-message\\\" style=\\\"display:none;\\\"><\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\\"siteNotice\\\"><\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\\"bodyContent\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\\"contentSub\\\"><\\/div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\\"mw-content-ltr\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\" id=\\\"mw-content-text\\\" lang=\\\"en\\\"><table cellspacing=\\\"3\\\" class=\\\"infobox\\\" style=\\\"border-spacing:3px;width:22em;\\\">\\n<tbody><tr>\\n<th colspan=\\\"2\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center;font-size:125%;font-weight:bold;line-height: 1.2em;

He is surrounded by boxes after he moved into a new house in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas, the previous day.\\nHe describes his new home as a \\\"monastery for programmers\\\". Levison and co-workers plan to live and work there as they create a new email service which will allow people to communicate entirely securely and privately. His goal, he says, is to \\\"spread encryption to the masses\\\".\\nIt is a new email service because Levison himself shut down his old one - called Lavabit - after a visit from the FBI.\\nIt began with a business card in May of last year. They were after the communications of one of his clients. Levison cannot say who it was but everyone knows it was Edward Snowden who had just left the country with a stash of secret documents and was using his Lavabit email to communicate.\\nA tussle with the FBI led to a court ordering Levison to hand over the keys to his email service. He feared it would leave all his 400,000 users vulnerable so he came up with a plan. The keys consisted of thousands of seemingly random characters. Rather than hand them over in electronic form, he printed them out. In tiny type. And then handed over the piece of paper.\\n\\\"I met the FBI agents in the lobby and I handed them the envelope and the FBI agent held it up to the light, wiggled it back and forth and was like 'Are these the keys?' And I said yeah. I just printed them out. He was like 'Oh'. So he wrote out a receipt for one sealed white envelope.\\\"\\nLevison knew that it would take time for the FBI to input the keys and that gave him the chance to shut down his entire system. He had named his machines after his ex-girlfriends and describes the process of pulling the plug as a \\\"surreal experience\\u2026 seeing all of the lights continue to blink out in the ether as all the users tried to continue to access their email even though the systems had been turned off.\\\"\\nAt the heart of Ladar Levison's case is a question. Do we want our communications to be entirely private so that absolutely no-one apart from the recipient can know what's being said? Or are we prepared to allow the state access - for instance when it says it is investigating crime or protecting national security? That issue has come to the forefront now because of Edward Snowden. But what's known as the crypto-wars have in fact been going on for 40 years.\\nYou could date the start to a meeting at Stanford University in California in 1976. On one side of the table were a pair of mathematicians - Martin Hellman and Whit Diffie. On the other were a team from the federal government - including the NSA.\\nHellman and Diffie believed that a proposed federal standard to encrypt data had been deliberately weakened by NSA to allow its supercomputers to break into communications. There had also been suspicions of so-called back doors which would allow the NSA secret access. In an increasingly heated exchange the two sides argued over how much computing power would be needed to break the proposed standard. \\\"My view at the time was that I was Luke Skywalker in Star Wars,\\\" Hellman tells me in his home on the sprawling Stanford Campus, \\\"and NSA was Darth Vadar.\\\"\\nSoon after that meeting, Diffie and Hellman revolutionised the world of codes by publishing a paper outlining a concept known as \\\"public key cryptography\\\". Until then the process of encrypting information was something only governments did, but public key offered the chance for ordinary people to be able to communicate securely.\\nAdm Bobby Ray Inman took over as NSA director in 1977. He found his staff worried by the intrusion into what had been their domain. \\\"The great worry was that this effort would produce cryptographic systems that they couldn't break and it wasn't just worry about drug dealers and the rest of that,\\\" he told me in his office in Austin Texas. \\\"It was that they could be picked up by foreign countries.\\\" Inman decided the two sides needed to talk and went to see Hellmann, which led to a dialogue between the NSA and the academic community.\\nBut encryption was spreading. Commercial companies began developing products they wanted to sell - and export. And activists began building systems for people to use - the most significant being Phil Zimmermann, whose PGP encryption programme ended up being distributed for free over the early internet. The FBI and NSA began to worry. \\\"It turns out that the biggest, most enthusiastic market for strong encryption are people who have a lot to hide,\\\" says Stewart Baker who took over as NSA's top lawyer in 1992 and who cites criminals, including paedophiles, as well as foreign spies as those who used the new systems. Those opposing the NSA argue though that these concerns should not trump the public's right to privacy.\\nBut by the end of the 1990s, encryption was out there and the crypto-wars looked to have been won. At least that is how it seemed at the time.\\nAt the annual RSA Security Conference in San Francisco a few weeks ago attendees got to choose a film to eat their popcorn in front of on cinema night. They picked Enemy of the State, a Will Smith thriller featuring rogue agents from the NSA.\\nEdward Snowden has become an enemy of the state but to many privacy activists, it is the state - and specifically the NSA - which is the enemy.\\nThe issues raised by Snowden - especially the claim that the NSA had worked to defeat encryption - hang over the meeting. A session on random number generators turns into a discussion as to whether the generators have been rigged by the NSA to provide a backdoor.\\n\\\"The government lost the crypto-wars,\\\" leading cryptographer and NSA critic Bruce Schneier explains in the margins of RSA. \\\"Crypto is now freely available but in a sense they won because there are so many ways at people's data that bypass the cryptography.\\n\\\"What we're learning from the Snowden documents is not that the NSA and GCHQ can break cryptography but that they can very often render it irrelevant\\u2026 They exploit bad implementations, bugs in hardware and software, default keys, weak keys, or they go in and break systems and steal data.\\\"\\nThe NSA has long shrouded itself in secrecy. But in recent months it has realised it needs to fight its corner. I was allowed into its headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, for an overview of its work - but without any recording devices. In a downtown Washington hotel though, I did speak to Chris Inglis, who stepped down as deputy director of the NSA. He is a man who is careful with his words but his anger at Edward Snowden's revelations lie just beneath the surface. \\\"There's a sense of betrayal that someone appointed himself judge and jury,\\\" he says, adding that America's adversaries will now have a \\\"greater sense\\\" how to avoid the NSA's attention.\\nWhat is encryption?\\nThe digital scrambling of source material, turning it into \\\"ciphertext\\\" - what appears to be a garbled stream of characters that is only supposed to become understandable if a piece of information called a \\\"key\\\" turns it back into its original form\\nHe argues that \\\"NSA does not have backdoors into the world's encryption writ large\\\".\\nThe NSA's \\\"principal forte\\\" he says \\\"is trying to find those things that are either inherent, accidental or merely the slips and pratfalls of people who don't implement these things properly.\\\"\\nAs to the claim that vulnerabilities are inserted into commercial systems to make them exploitable, Inglis does not deny the possibility but suggests such techniques would only be used selectively. \\\"Any activity of that sort would then in my view be focused on a very specific target - probably tactically focused and only for those legitimate purposes.\\\" The NSA has defensive and offensive roles - with securing national security information as well as stealing that of others - but the tension between these roles has been highlighted by the increasingly widespread use of commercial cryptography, including by the government itself.\\nEncryption is invisible but it is everywhere today. Every time you bank or buy something online, when you make a call on your mobile or when your key fob opens your car. Crypto may be out there. But the crypto-wars - the battle between those who believe privacy is king, and those who support the state's right to listen in - are only going to grow fiercer.\\nListen to Gordon Corera's report on Crypto-wars on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 16 March at 13:30 GMT or catch up afterwards on iPlayer\",\"title\":\"Who is winning the 'crypto-war'?\",\"images\":[{\"primary\":\"true\",\"caption\":\"File illustration photo of a magnifying glass being held in front of a computer screen in Berlin May 21, 2013\",\"url\":\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73586000/jpg/_73586029_password-encryption.jpg\"},{\"caption\":\"Ladar Levison on his sofa with dog, Princess\",\"url\":\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73586000/jpg/_73586756_levison.jpg\"},{\"caption\":\"Lavison's letter to Lavabit users \",\"url\":\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73586000/jpg/_73586761_lavabit-email.jpg\"},{\"caption\":\"NSA's Utah data centre \",\"url\":\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73586000/jpg/_73586760_utah-nsa-data-centre-ap.jpg\"}],\"html\":\"<div class=\\\"story-body\\\">\\n    \\t\\t  \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n     \\n         \\n \\n    \\n    \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t    \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n        <div class=\\\"caption full-width\\\">\\n  <img alt=\\\"File illustration photo of a magnifying glass being held in front of a computer screen in Berlin May 21, 2013\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"424\\\" src=\\\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73586000/jpg/_73586029_password-encryption.jpg\\\" width=\\\"624\\\"><\\/img>\\n\\n  <\\/div>\\n                      <p class=\\\"introduction\\\" id=\\\"story_continues_1\\\">In the war over encryption between the NSA and privacy activists, who is winning?<\\/p>\\n        <p>Ladar Levison sits exhausted, slumped on a sofa with his dog Princess on his lap.

The court wasn\\u2019t sanctioning the behavior, only acknowledging that without case law they couldn\\u2019t convict this person of a crime. Within days of the ruling the legislature crafted a law and sent it to the governor for his signature. This was a case where the law caught up with the technology and defined a social norm in legal terms on the fly.\\nAnd over time, it\\u2019s entirely likely that similar situations will pop up with Glass and we will have to define social and legal norms about how it\\u2019s acceptable to use them.\\nAs Kamen says, it\\u2019s up to us to figure out how to use technology in an intelligent way. \\u201cTechnology makes it so easy to innovate.

 "{\"icon\":\"https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/yV/r/hzMapiNYYpW.ico\",\"text\":\"Facebook\\u2019s mission is to help people connect with one another, and as our 10th anniversary approached last month, we wanted to do something that would let everyone participate in the event together. After some discussion, we settled on the Look Back feature, which allows people to generate one-minute videos that highlight memorable photos and posts from their time on Facebook.\\nThe feature proved to be a hit: people watched and shared hundreds of millions of these videos in the first few days following the launch on February 4. From an engineering perspective, Look Back proved to be a very interesting challenge \\u2013 in no small part because we had to build it in less than a month.\\nHow it began\\nIn early January, we decided to move forward with the idea of creating Look Back videos. At that point, only a handful people at Facebook knew of the concept, and we had only a faint idea of how we would make more than a billion videos in 25 days.\\nWe knew from the start that there would be some big challenges in building it this quickly, and at this scale. Infrastructure engineers started to think about storage requirements, computing capacity and network bandwidth. Questions about the videos themselves needed to be answered. How would we animate photos for a billion people? How could we make the videos feel personal and present them in a way that would resonate?\\nIn addition, this was already a busy time for Facebook\\u2019s infrastructure team \\u2013 our new Paper app would launch just five days before February 4, and a week later the site would be inundated with activity from the start of the 2014 Winter Olympics.\\nTo plan for even more load, we began with some educated guesses, put them through some back-of-the-envelope math, and decided to plan for 25 million videos shared within a day of the anniversary. We estimated that for every video shared, five people would watch that video. Multiplying those views by the video size, dividing by seconds in a day, we calculated that we would need an average additional bandwidth of about 62 Gbps. Since traffic can be 2-3x higher at peak, we actually needed to plan for 187 Gbps. That\\u2019s more than 20,000 average US high-speed internet connections, fully saturated all the time. Our network engineers had some work to do.\\nTo store videos for everyone, we would need an estimated 25 petabytes of disk space. Visualized as a stack of standard 1TB laptop drives, this would be a tower measuring more than 775 feet tall \\u2013 two-thirds the height of the Empire State Building. We couldn\\u2019t make the videos without having this space, so the disks had to be procured within a week or two at the most.\\nTo add to the suspense, the amount of computing power needed to render the videos was still an unknown.\\nRender faster, store better\\nWhen we kicked off the project, we could generate videos for only about 7 million people per day \\u2013 and at that rate we would need months to render all the videos we needed. We had less than three weeks to go at this point.\\nHow could we expedite the process? It was time to divide and conquer. We quickly split the entire pipeline into smaller pieces that could evolve in parallel, and many volunteers jumped in to figure out how to tackle the following tasks:\\nStore the videos\\nObtain enough computing capacity\\nStay within the electrical power limits of our data centers\\nEnsure sufficient network bandwidth (internal and to the Internet)\\nChoose compelling photos and status updates for the videos\\nDistribute and schedule the video rendering jobs\\nAnimate the content, and render the videos\\nDesign and build the web and mobile front-ends\\nDesign and build an editing interface to let people customize their videos\\nEnable the edited videos to be rendered quickly on-demand\\nManage the deployment of all these software iterations\\nFor storage, we reviewed how our Haystack media servers were configured, including their geographical location in the US. Particularly important was the need to prevent disruptions to normal site operations. So we decided to isolate these videos in their own servers across both US coasts and treat them as different video types than regular uploads. Additionally, we decided to keep fewer archived copies of the Look Back videos to save space and time.\\nBut even if we had every drive in the system working in perfect unison, we would easily saturate the top of rack switches moving all that data in and out. The easiest solution to this problem was to simply deploy more hardware, which meant we had to find, provision, configure, and deploy even more racks to spread the read/write workload across more network switches. For compute, although we had tens of thousands of servers available, our data center power efficiency plans were not designed for all of them to be running at full capacity at all times. We decided to track power usage while the jobs were running and added dials to the software to allow us to slow down if needed.\\nWith the initial setup in place, we tested the end-to-end pipeline with a prototype of the Look Back feature on about 150 employees. We continued to secure more capacity for the feature, and the team made hourly code changes and re-rendered videos to ensure that the software worked consistently and reliably for everyone. On January 24, we launched the Look Back videos internally to all Facebook employees. While there were still some bugs at this point, the feedback on the feature was overwhelmingly positive, and more people pitched in to help scale it.\\nConcurrently, a second team of engineers turned their attention to another issue: ensuring that the Look Back tool wouldn\\u2019t disrupt the rest of Facebook. We began by monitoring power on the capacity we were claiming across our data centers. We usually understand application behavior and can identify power limits, but given our deadline, we knew we would be pushing the envelope. Once we determined that storage was holding up and the thousands of servers that had been provisioned were ready to work, we alerted our CDN partners to expect a high volume of traffic.\\nWith just a few days to go, we realized that we had a chance to hit our target \\u2013 what had originally been estimated as a six-month task was being compressed into a 96-hour all-out assault.\\nBy February 3, we\\u2019d done it. We had all the videos ready for launch, and we had accomplished it a day early. Over the previous six days, we watched the space used in Haystack grow from 0 bytes to 11 petabytes, rendering over 9 million videos per hour at our fastest. We ended up needing less than half of the space we estimated for two reasons: we were able to reduce the replication factor for these videos, since they became easier to regenerate, and we had managed to optimize the video size without compromising quality.\\nHappy birthday, Facebook! Let\\u2019s ship!\\nFinally, on February 4, we shipped. People saw the new feature, checked out their videos, and rapidly began sharing those videos with friends.\\nWe had anticipated that about 10% of the people who saw their video would share it. Instead, to our surprise, well over 40% of the viewers were sharing. As much stress as this was putting on our infrastructure, it also revealed the answer to the one question we couldn\\u2019t predict in advance: would the videos be a hit? In just a few hours, it was clear that the answer was a resounding yes. A few hours after launch, the outgoing network capacity was nearly double our projected peak.\\nFigure: Outgoing bandwidth for Look Back videos\\nShortly after 12:00 pm Pacific time, Look Back videos were going out at over 450 Gbps \\u2013 which is big even by Facebook standards.\\nWhen all was said and done, we took a step back to look at the numbers:\\nOver 720 million videos rendered, with 9 million videos rendered per hour\\nMore than 11 petabytes of storage used\\nMore than 450 Gbps outgoing bandwidth at peak and 4 PB egress within days\\nOver 200 million people watched their Look Back movie in the first two days, and more than 50% have shared their movie.\\nAnd all of this came without a single power breaker tripping \\u2013 which made our data center teams very happy.\\n30 teams working as one\\nNo official team owned the Look Back feature; it came about only because dozens of people from across the company came together to do something they found meaningful and important.\\nNormally, our hardware teams plan months in advance and work very deliberately. In January, they suddenly needed to move tens of thousands of computers to new tasks overnight. Anytime servers are provisioned, a small percentage will fail and need maintenance. Dealing with those failures can be time-consuming, since a person often has to physically walk to a computer inside a huge data center, troubleshoot it, and replace any failed parts. The data center teams stayed around the clock to make sure that every provisioned machine was working properly.\\nThis snowball effect was not new for successful projects at Facebook. For Look Back, two things made it possible: first, Facebook employees are empowered to work on the things they believe are important. Second, the social fabric of the company is so strong that everyone knew other people on the impromptu team \\u2014 nobody had to walk into a roomful of strangers. For the dozens of people orienting themselves in a new and rapidly moving effort, the friendly energy made all the difference.\\nThe Look Back project represented the things we love about Facebook culture: coming up with bold ideas, moving fast to make them real, and helping hundreds of millions of people connect with those who are important to them.

Her claims that she faced a sexist internal culture at GitHub came as a surprise to some, given her former defense of the startup and her internal work at the company to promote women in technology.\\nIn her initial tweets on her departure, Horvath did not provide extensive clarity on why she left the highly valued startup, or who created the conditions that led to her leaving and publicly repudiating the company.\\nHorvath has given TechCrunch her version of the events, a story that contains serious allegations towards GitHub, its internal policies, and its culture. The situation has greater import than a single person\\u2019s struggle: Horvath\\u2019s story is a tale of what many underrepresented groups feel and experience in the tech sector.\\nHorvath said she joined GitHub in 2012 when the company was \\u201cstill pretty small\\u201d and its culture was supportive of the women on its staff. She said that at the time she was the only female designer or developer on the team. Despite GitHub\\u2019s generally female-friendly environment, Horvath claims: \\u201cI had a really hard time getting used to the culture, the aggressive communication on pull requests and how little the men I worked with respected and valued my opinion,\\u201d she wrote in an email to TechCrunch.\\nWhy did Horvath work for GitHub? She \\u201cloved the idea of GitHub because it was the place people went to make things for people who make things.\\u201d\\nIn light of that, Horvath told us that she \\u201cparticipated in the boys\\u2019 club upon joining,\\u201d but when her \\u201ccharacter started being discussed in inappropriate places like on pull requests and issues,\\u201d the situation changed.\\nIn short, Horvath said that she felt she was being treated differently internally simply due to her gender and not the quality of her work. She calls her colleagues\\u2019 response to her own work and the work of other female GitHub employees a \\u201cserious problem.\\u201d Despite GitHub hiring more female developers, Horvath said she struggled to feel welcome.\\nAdding to the already difficult situation was the wife of a founder whom she did not name in her email. Horvath says she did her best to distance herself from the founder\\u2019s wife, as well as the founder, for fear of being caught up in an unhealthy situation. But, as she told TechCrunch, she didn\\u2019t \\u201cmove quickly enough.\\u201d\\nThe wife of the founder asked Horvath out for drinks, which she agreed to. In her own words: \\u201cOf course I agreed, seeing as she was my boss\\u2019s wife and I\\u2019m always looking to meet women I can look up to.\\u201d\\nAccording to Horvath: \\u201cI met her and almost immediately the conversation that I thought was supposed to be casual turned into something very inappropriate. She began telling me about how she informs her husband\\u2019s decision-making at GitHub, how I better not leave GitHub and write something bad about them, and how she had been told by her husband that she should intervene with my relationship to be sure I was \\u2018made very happy\\u2019 so that I wouldn\\u2019t quit and say something nasty about her husband\\u2019s company because \\u2018he had worked so hard.\\u2019\\u201d\\nWe are awaiting comment from GitHub regarding these allegations, and GitHub says it is looking into it. It\\u2019s not clear why this founder or his spouse appear to have felt threatened by Horvath\\u2019s employment.\\nAccording to Horvath, the wife went on to claim that she was responsible for hires at GitHub, and asked Horvath to explain to her what she was working on. The wife also claimed to employ \\u201cspies\\u201d inside of GitHub, and claimed to be able to, again according to Horvath, read GitHub employees\\u2019 private chat-room logs, which only employees are supposed to have access to.\\nHorvath called the situation, aptly, \\u201cbananas.\\u201d\\nIn her email to TechCrunch, Horvath says she felt \\u201cconfused and insulted to think that a woman who was not employed by my company was pulling the strings.\\u201d She also said she felt bullied by someone with perceived power and influence over her personal relationship and her career at GitHub.\\nIn retrospect, Horvath said she feels like she should have handed in her resignation following the episode.\\nMy only regret is not leaving or being fired sooner. What I endured as an employee of GitHub was unacceptable and went unnoticed by most.\\u2014 Julie Ann Horvath (@nrrrdcore) March 15, 2014\\nHorvath then told her partner, also a GitHub employee, about what was happening. She warned him against being close to the founder and his wife, and asked him not to relay information to them. According to Horvath, her partner \\u201cagreed this was best.\\u201d He had talked with the founder\\u2019s wife, who agreed to give Horvath space.\\nInstead of the issue blowing over, Horvath received a meeting request from HR at GitHub, and was asked to \\u201crelay the details of that personal conversation that took place out of the office.\\u201d Horvath recalls that she was \\u201cuncomfortable with this but complied to the best of my ability.\\u201d Her partner was also asked to relay past events.\\nRadio silence ensued for a month, according to Horvath, while rumors cropped up that the founder was asking other employees about her, as well as her relationship with her partner. To Horvath, the silence made her think that she was \\u201cbeing bullied into leaving.\\u201d\\nAt this point, Horvath said she began to feel threatened. She said that having her personal relationship dragged into her work life and put on show for her coworkers didn\\u2019t sit well with her. The aforementioned wife began a pattern of passive-aggressive behavior that included sitting close to Horvath to, as she told TechCrunch, \\u201cmake a point of intimidating\\u201d her.\\nThis stalemate ended when the founder asked to see her. Horvath said that she \\u201cwasn\\u2019t going to put myself in a position like that, so I required HR be present if we were to meet.\\u201d The meeting did not go well.\\nAccording to Horvath, the founder accused her of threatening his wife, who she had not interacted with or contacted since the wife asked her out to drinks. Horvath cried during the episode, as she said the founder both \\u201cchastised\\u201d her and called her a \\u201cliar.\\u201d Horvath said the founder ended the meeting by saying that it was \\u201cbad judgement\\u201d to date coworkers (referring to her relationship, which was with another employee at GitHub) and then left. Horvath recalls sitting there after his departure both \\u201ccrying and shaking uncontrollably.\\u201d\\nWe are waiting for comment from GitHub about these allegations.\\nHorvath later learned that the founder had a similar talk with her partner and demanded that he resign. Her partner is still at the company.\\nIn Horvath\\u2019s view, her options were limited, given that \\u201cHR and the other founders had allowed this to happen, even after being made aware of his and her behavior.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t clear whom she could turn to.\\nWhile the above was going on, Horvath had what she referred to as an awkward, almost aggressive encounter with another GitHub employee, who asked himself over to \\u201ctalk,\\u201d and then professed his love, and \\u201chesitated\\u201d when he was asked to leave. Horvath was in a committed relationship at the time, something this other employee was well aware of, according to Horvath.\\nThe rejection of the other employee led to something of an internal battle at GitHub. According to Horvath, the engineer, \\u201churt from my rejection, started passive-aggressively ripping out my code from projects we had worked on together without so much as a ping or a comment. I even had to have a few of his commits reverted. I would work on something, go to bed, and wake up to find my work gone without any explanation.\\u201d The employee in question, according to Horvath, is both \\u201cwell-liked at GitHub\\u201d and \\u201cpopular in the community.\\u201d\\nHis \\u201cbehavior towards female employees,\\u201d according to Horvath, \\u201cespecially those he sees as opportunities is disgusting.\\u201d\\nSeeking to create something positive out of the above complexity, Horvath decided to start Passion Projects, an initiative that she now claims \\u201cwasn\\u2019t just to fix tech,\\u201d but was also something designed to \\u201cfix GitHub and to strengthen the support network for women who might be experiencing similar things.\\u201d\\nYet things failed to improve internally. Horvath calls the next period \\u201cuglier.\\u201d She says that the wife of the founder continued to show up at the office, sit next to her and \\u201cglare\\u201d at her for extended periods of time \\u201cas if trying to provoke a reaction.\\u201d After a spell, \\u201cspending a lot of time in the women\\u2019s bathroom crying,\\u201d Horvath spoke to a different founder who was \\u201csympathetic\\u201d and promised to \\u201caddress\\u201d the situation with the other founder and his wife.\\nThe first founder asked to meet. Horvath accepted. The founder apologized, and admitted to having \\u201cinappropriately escalated the situation.\\u201d His wife, he said, would work from home from then on. The wife, to be clear, was not a GitHub employee.\\nInstead of getting gone, the wife appeared the next day and \\u201cplanted herself right in front\\u201d of Horvath. Horvath pinged various executives who were \\u201cbusy\\u201d but willing to help eventually.\\nThe situation wasn\\u2019t merely passively painful; according to Horvath it became virulent:\\nThe next thing I knew the wife was in my face at my work station verbally attacking me. She demanded to speak with me in private to which I said no. I asked her in a very calm way to leave me alone and told her she was making me uncomfortable. There is an eye-witness to this event.\\nI was shaking in horror and felt my adrenaline pumping harder than ever before. I was proud of myself for not reacting, though.\\nI decided to work from home for a while.\\nHR eventually asked the wife to not be on the same floor as Horvath. But according to Horvath\\u2019s recount, \\u201cshe continued to find her way in and plant herself right next to wherever I was working.\\u201d This continued until her exit from the firm this past Thursday.\\nThe final straw for Horvath came when she saw men gawking at women who were hula-hooping at the office. She called the episode \\u201ca really ugly and inappropriate scene.\\u201d Her words:\\nTwo women, one of whom I work with and adore, and a friend of hers were hula hooping to some music. I didn\\u2019t have a problem with this. What I did have a problem with is the line of men sitting on one bench facing the hoopers and gawking at them. It looked like something out of a strip club. When I brought this up to male coworkers, they didn\\u2019t see a problem with it. But for me it felt unsafe and to be honest, really embarrassing. That was the moment I decided to finally leave GitHub.\\nHorvath told TechCrunch that she thought she \\u201ccould fix GitHub.\\u201d She now claims that she was wrong.\\nAfter working with HR to secure and announce a simple exit from the firm, someone posted a very unkind post to the Secret social network concerning her tenure. Her exit, at that time, was still confidential. She contacted Secret asking for the post to be removed. Horvath claims the post was not taken down initially. TechCrunch has confirmed with Secret that it was eventually removed.\\nThe Secret post is what led Horvath to \\u201cspeak up.\\u201d Instead of seeking attention, Horvath says she wants someone to be finally held accountable.\\nGitHub says it is investigating the matter: \\u201cWe\\u2019re looking into this.\\u201d\",\"title\":\"Julie Ann Horvath Describes Sexism And Intimidation Behind Her GitHub Exit\",\"images\":[{\"primary\":\"true\",\"caption\":\"Julie Ann Horvath Describes Sexism And Intimidation Behind Her GitHub Exit\",\"url\":\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/shadow-octocat.jpg?w=1279&h=727&crop=1\"},{\"caption\":\"Screen Shot 2014-03-15 at 8.06.03 PM\",\"url\":\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-15-at-8-06-03-pm.png?w=337&h=332\"},{\"url\":\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/secret.jpg?w=680&h=604\"}],\"html\":\"<img alt=\\\"Julie Ann Horvath Describes Sexism And Intimidation Behind Her GitHub\u00a0Exit\\\" class=\\\"img-hero diffbot_image\\\" src=\\\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/shadow-octocat.jpg?w=1279&h=727&crop=1\\\"><\\/img><div class=\\\"article-entry text l-featured-container\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n<p>The exit of engineer&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/nrrrdcore\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Julie Ann Horvath<\\/a>&nbsp;from programming network&nbsp;GitHub has sparked yet another conversation concerning women in technology and startups.

According to Horvath, her partner &ldquo;agreed this was best.&rdquo; He had talked with the founder&rsquo;s wife, who agreed to give Horvath space.<\\/p><aside class=\\\"inset inset-sm inset-section\\\"><section class=\\\"aside section video-aside collapse\\\">\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n<\\/section>\\n<\\/aside>\\n<p>Instead of the issue blowing over, Horvath received a meeting request from HR at GitHub, and was asked to &ldquo;relay the details of that personal conversation that took place out of the office.&rdquo; Horvath recalls that she was &ldquo;uncomfortable with this but complied to the best of my ability.&rdquo; Her partner was also asked to relay past events.<\\/p>\\n<p>Radio silence ensued for a month, according to Horvath, while rumors cropped up that the founder was asking other employees about her, as well as her relationship with her partner. To Horvath, the silence made her think that she was &ldquo;being bullied into leaving.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>At this point, Horvath said she began to feel threatened. She said that having her personal relationship dragged into her work life and put on show for her coworkers didn&rsquo;t sit well with her. The aforementioned wife began a pattern of passive-aggressive&nbsp;behavior that included sitting close to Horvath to, as she told TechCrunch, &ldquo;make a point of intimidating&rdquo; her.<\\/p>\\n<p>This stalemate ended when the founder asked to see her. Horvath said&nbsp;that she &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t going to put myself in a position like that, so I required HR be present if we were to meet.&rdquo; The meeting did not go well.<\\/p>\\n<p>According to Horvath, the founder accused her of threatening his wife, who she had not interacted with or contacted since the wife asked her out to drinks.&nbsp;Horvath cried during the episode, as she said the founder both &ldquo;chastised&rdquo; her and called her a &ldquo;liar.&rdquo; Horvath said the founder ended the meeting by saying that it was &ldquo;bad judgement&rdquo; to date coworkers (referring to her relationship, which was with another employee at GitHub) and then left. Horvath recalls sitting there after his departure both &ldquo;crying and shaking uncontrollably.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>We are waiting for comment from GitHub about these allegations.<\\/p>\\n<p>Horvath later learned that the founder had a similar talk with her partner and demanded that he resign. Her partner is still at the company.<\\/p>\\n<p>In Horvath&rsquo;s view, her options were limited, given that &ldquo;HR and the other founders had allowed this to happen, even after being made aware of his and her behavior.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t clear whom she could turn to.<\\/p>\\n<p>While the above was going on, Horvath had what she referred to as an awkward, almost aggressive encounter with another GitHub employee, who asked himself over to &ldquo;talk,&rdquo; and then professed his love, and &ldquo;hesitated&rdquo; when he was asked to leave. Horvath was in a committed relationship at the time, something this other employee was well aware of, according to Horvath.<\\/p>\\n<p>The rejection of the other employee led to something of an internal battle at GitHub. According to Horvath, the engineer, &ldquo;hurt from my rejection, started passive-aggressively ripping out my code from projects we had worked on together without so much as a ping or a comment. I even had to have a few of his commits reverted. I would work on something, go to bed, and wake up to find my work gone without any explanation.&rdquo; The employee in question, according to Horvath, is both &ldquo;well-liked at GitHub&rdquo; and &ldquo;popular in the community.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>His &ldquo;behavior towards female employees,&rdquo; according to Horvath, &ldquo;especially those he sees as opportunities is disgusting.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>Seeking to create something positive out of the above complexity, Horvath decided to start&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://passion-projects.github.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Passion Projects<\\/a>, an initiative that she now claims &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t just to fix tech,&rdquo; but was also something designed to &ldquo;fix GitHub and to strengthen the support network for women who might be experiencing similar things.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>Yet things failed to improve internally. Horvath calls the next period &ldquo;uglier.&rdquo; She says that the wife of the founder continued to show up at the office, sit next to her and &ldquo;glare&rdquo; at her for extended periods of time &ldquo;as if trying to provoke a reaction.&rdquo;&nbsp;After a spell, &ldquo;spending a lot of time in the women&rsquo;s bathroom crying,&rdquo; Horvath spoke to a different founder who was &ldquo;sympathetic&rdquo; and promised to &ldquo;address&rdquo; the situation with the other founder and his wife.<\\/p><aside class=\\\"inset inset-sm inset-section\\\">\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\\"section aside crunchbase-cluster collapse\\\">\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n<\\/div>\\n\\n\\n<\\/aside>\\n<p>The first founder asked to meet. Horvath accepted. The founder apologized, and admitted to having &ldquo;inappropriately escalated the situation.&rdquo; His wife, he said, would work from home from then on. The wife, to be clear, was not a GitHub employee.<\\/p>\\n<p>Instead of getting gone, the wife appeared the next day and &ldquo;planted herself right in front&rdquo; of Horvath. Horvath pinged various executives who were &ldquo;busy&rdquo; but willing to help eventually.<\\/p>\\n<p>The situation wasn&rsquo;t merely passively painful; according to Horvath it became virulent:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote><p><i>The next thing I knew the wife was in my face at my work station verbally attacking me. She demanded to speak with me in private to which I said no. I asked her in a very calm way to leave me alone and told her she was making me uncomfortable. There is an eye-witness to this event.<\\/i><\\/p>\\n<p><i>I was shaking in horror and felt my adrenaline pumping harder than ever before. I was proud of myself for not reacting, though.<\\/i><\\/p>\\n<p><i>I decided to work from home for a while.<\\/i><\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p>HR eventually asked the wife to not be on the same floor as Horvath. But according to Horvath&rsquo;s recount, &ldquo;she continued to find her way in and plant herself right next to wherever I was working.&rdquo; This continued until her exit from the firm this past Thursday.<\\/p>\\n<p>The final straw for Horvath came when she saw men gawking at women who were hula-hooping at the office. She called the episode &ldquo;a really ugly and inappropriate scene.&rdquo; Her words:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote><p><i>Two women, one of whom I work with and adore, and a friend of hers were hula hooping to some music. I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with this. What I did have a problem with is the line of men sitting on one bench facing the hoopers and gawking at them. It looked like something out of a strip club. When I brought this up to male coworkers, they didn&rsquo;t see a problem with it. But for me it felt unsafe and to be honest, really embarrassing. That was the moment I decided to finally leave GitHub.<\\/i><\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p>Horvath told TechCrunch that she thought she &ldquo;could fix GitHub.&rdquo; She now claims that she was wrong.<\\/p>\\n<p><img alt=\\\"secret\\\" class=\\\"size-large wp-image-973317 aligncenter diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"604\\\" src=\\\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/secret.jpg?w=680&h=604\\\" width=\\\"680\\\"><\\/img><br>\\nAfter working with HR to secure and announce a simple exit from the firm, someone posted a very unkind post to the Secret social network concerning her tenure. Her exit, at that time, was still confidential. She contacted Secret asking for the post to be removed. Horvath claims the post was not taken down initially. TechCrunch has confirmed with Secret that it was eventually removed.<\\/p>\\n<p>The Secret post is what led Horvath to &ldquo;speak up.&rdquo;&nbsp;Instead of seeking attention, Horvath says she wants someone to be finally held accountable.<\\/p>\\n<p>GitHub&nbsp;says it is investigating the matter: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking into this.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled\\\" id=\\\"jp-post-flair\\\"><\\/div>\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\\"hide-med-max cf social-share\\\" id=\\\"social-after-wrapper\\\">\\n\\t<ul class=\\\"inline-list social-share-list is-hidden\\\" id=\\\"social-after\\\">\\n\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t<a class=\\\"icon-facebook\\\" href=\\\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/\\\" rel=\\\"external\\\"><span class=\\\"social-count\\\" id=\\\"fb-newshare-973307\\\"><\\/span><\\/a>\\n\\t\\t<\\/li>\\n\\t\\t<li class=\\\"twitter\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<a class=\\\"icon-twitter\\\" href=\\\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/\\\" rel=\\\"external\\\"><span class=\\\"social-count\\\" id=\\\"tweet-newshare-973307\\\"><\\/span><\\/a>\\n\\t\\t<\\/li>\\n\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t<a class=\\\"icon-linkedin\\\" href=\\\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/\\\" rel=\\\"external\\\"><span class=\\\"social-count\\\" id=\\\"linkedin-newshare-973307\\\"><\\/span><\\/a>\\n\\t\\t<\\/li>\\n\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\\"g-plusone\\\" data-annotation=\\\"bubble\\\" data-href=\\\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/\\\" data-size=\\\"medium\\\" data-width=\\\"60\\\"><\\/div>\\n\\t\\t<\\/li>\\n\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t<suU00003Abadge layout=\\\"1\\\" location=\\\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/?ncid=su_social_share\\\" type=\\\"badge\\\"><\\/suU00003Abadge>\\n\\t\\t<\\/li>\\n\\t\\t<li>\\n\\t\\t\\t<a class=\\\"reddit\\\" href=\\\"http://www.reddit.com/submit?title=Julie%20Ann%20Horvath%20Describes%20Sexism%20And%20Intimidation%20Behind%20Her%20GitHub%20Exit&url=http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/%3Fncid%3Dreddit_social_share\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><img alt=\\\"submit to reddit\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://s1.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/reddit.gif?m=1381204869g\\\"><\\/img><\\/a>\\n\\t\\t<\\/li>\\n\\t<\\/ul>\\n<\\/div>\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\\\"grv-personalization-56\\\"><\\/div>\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t<\\/div>\",\"date\":\"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT\",\"type\":\"article\",\"url\":\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/\"}",

Why that makes some educators worried about America\\u2019s future\\nIn 1971, researchers at Johns Hopkins University embarked on an ambitious effort to identify brilliant 12-year-olds and track their education and careers through the rest of their lives. The Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth, which now includes 5,000 people, would eventually become the world\\u2019s longest-running longitudinal survey of what happens to intellectually talented children (in math and other areas) as they grow up. It has generated seven books, more than 300 papers, and a lot of what we know about early aptitude.\\nDavid Lubinski is a psychologist at Vanderbilt University, where the project has been based since the 1990s. He and his wife and fellow Vanderbilt professor, Camilla Benbow, codirect the study and have dedicated their careers to learning about this exceptional population.\\n\\u201cThis is like putting a magnifying glass on the tippy, tippy top of the distribution,\\u201d he says.\\nIn a recent paper, Lubinski and his colleagues caught up with one cohort of 320 people now in their late 30s. At 12, their SAT math or verbal scores had placed them among the top one-100th of 1 percent. Today, many are CEOs, professors at top research universities, transplant surgeons, and successful novelists.\\nThat outcome sounds like exactly what you\\u2019d imagine should happen: Top young people grow into high-achieving adults. In the education world, the study has provided important new evidence that it really is possible to identify the kids who are likely to become exceptional achievers in the future, something previous research has not always found to be the case. But for that reason, perhaps surprisingly, it has also triggered a new round of worry.\\nLubinski\\u2019s unusually successful cohort was also a lucky group from the start\\u2014they participated in the study in the first place because their parents or teachers encouraged them to take the SAT at age 12. Previous research into gifted children has shown that many, or even most of them, aren\\u2019t so lucky: They aren\\u2019t identified early, and they don\\u2019t necessarily get special attention from their schools. Even among Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth participants, the Vanderbilt researchers have previously found that those who weren\\u2019t challenged in school were less likely to live up to the potential indicated by their test scores. Other research has shown that under-stimulated gifted students quickly become bored and frustrated\\u2014especially if they come from low-income families that are not equipped to provide them with enrichment outside of school.\\n\\u201cWhat the study underscored is the tremendous amount of potential here\\u2014they\\u2019re a national resource,\\u201d Lubinski says. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s hard to separate the findings of this study from what we know about gifted kids in general. The genuine concern is, we know we\\u2019re not identifying all of this population. We\\u2019re not getting nearly enough, and we\\u2019re losing them.\\u201d\\nTo people more worried about kids who are falling through the cracks altogether, doing slightly less than we could for the most gifted might not seem like a pressing problem. But if the study is right that exceptional youthful ability really does correlate directly with exceptional adult achievement, then these talented young kids aren\\u2019t just a challenge for schools and parents: they\\u2019re also demonstrably important to America\\u2019s future. And it means that if, in education, we focus on steering all extra money and attention toward kids who are struggling academically, or even just to the average student, we risk shortchanging the country in a different way.\\n\\u201cWe are in a talent war, and we\\u2019re living in a global economy now,\\u201d Lubinski says. \\u201cThese are the people who are going to figure out all the riddles. Schizophrenia, cancer\\u2014they\\u2019re going to fight terrorism, they\\u2019re going to create patents and the scientific innovations that drive our economy. But they are not given a lot of opportunities in schools that are designed for typically developing kids.\\u201d\\nGiven all the pressures our education system faces, it seems almost indecent to worry about the travails of a small minority of very smart children. Understandably, federal and state education policy has long focused on more obvious problems that education can help address\\u2014problems such as the yawning gaps between the test scores of rich and poor students and between different racial groups. Tax dollars disproportionately go to help kids with learning disabilities and other disadvantages, because society generally agrees that they are most in need of help.\\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act, which penalizes public schools that don\\u2019t bring the lowest-performing students up to grade level. The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act regulates special education and provides schools with more than $11 billion annually. A provision of federal education law called Title I allocates some $14 billion to schools that have a higher proportion of students from low-income families, to pay for programs designed to keep them from falling behind.\\nThe smartest kid in class, by contrast, is not an expensive problem. A boy or girl who finishes an assignment early can be handed a book and told to read quietly while the teacher works on getting other children caught up. What would clearly be neglect if it happened to a special-needs child tends to look different if the child is gifted: Being left alone might even feel like a reward, an acknowledgment of being a fast learner.\\nNot surprisingly, programs oriented toward gifted children get barely any federal funding. The Javits Act, the only federal law aimed at gifted students, pays for research and pilot education programs and is currently funded at $5 million, down from a peak of $11 million several years ago.\\nGifted students do have their own advocacy group, the National Association for Gifted Children. This coalition of parents and educators is currently pushing a bipartisan bill called the Talent Act, which would require states and school districts to set policies for gifted education and report on the performance of advanced students. (In a concession to reality, the act does not seek any new funding.) The group\\u2019s former president, Paula Olszewski-Kubilius, says that in an ideal world the federal government would require that gifted students be identified early and would fund schools\\u2019 efforts to train teachers and provide enrichment or accelerated learning programs.\\nOlszewski-Kubilius, an education professor at Northwestern University, considers the latest Vanderbilt finding important to the cause. \\u201cIt\\u2019s probably the best research we have that connects childhood giftedness with adult achievement,\\u201d she says. She chalks up the current disparity to an otherwise well-intentioned attitude, one that seems to be ingrained in American culture.\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s a fundamental belief, not just among educators but in general in our society\\u2014and the word \\u2018gifted\\u2019 doesn\\u2019t help\\u2014that, well, they lucked out by virtue of genetics. They\\u2019ve got something other people don\\u2019t have, and so they should just be satisfied with that. They don\\u2019t need any more.\\u201d\\nResearch, however, suggests that they do\\u2014or at least that they benefit from extra investment. Two recent papers based on data from the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth and published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that, among young people with off-the-charts ability, those who had been given special accommodations\\u2014even modest ones, like being allowed to skip a grade, enroll in special classes, or take college-level courses in high school\\u2014went on to publish more academic papers, earn more patents, and pursue higher-level careers than their equally smart peers who didn\\u2019t have these opportunities. In one of the studies, the Vanderbilt researchers matched students who skipped a grade with a control group of similarly smart kids who didn\\u2019t. The grade-skippers, it turned out, were 60 percent more likely to earn doctorates or patents and more than twice as likely to get a PhD in science, math, or engineering.\\n\\u201cIf you look at the control group\\u201d in the grade-skipping study, says Lubinski, \\u201cthey\\u2019ll say, \\u2018The curriculum was moving too slow, I felt bored, I was frustrated.\\u2019 Those kids still do better than the norm, but the ones who have their developmental needs met, they do much better.\\u201d\\nBut providing these smart kids with an education that matches their abilities is not as straightforward as it sounds. Politically, it raises the fraught question of whether our education system should be in the business of identifying and segregating elite students\\u2014an idea that has been tried and rejected before, for good reasons.\\nFor most of the 20th century, schools routinely divided students into advanced, average, and remedial categories, a practice called \\u201ctracking\\u201d that was largely discredited by research showing it only exacerbated inequality, especially inequality linked to race and class.\\n\\u201cThe original basis was the idea that some people are born to lead and others are born to follow, so you identify the leaders early and train them to lead,\\u201d says Samuel Lucas, a Berkeley sociologist whose research has focused on inequality in education. Those who were groomed to be followers, he notes, consistently wound up with worse teachers, scarcer supplies, and a weaker curriculum than their more advanced peers.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s difficult to introduce stratification into the system without introducing inequality in how people get into those stratifications,\\u201d Lucas says. \\u201cStudents at the bottom should be getting the best of resources so they can catch up. They certainly shouldn\\u2019t be getting worse resources, and the research shows that this is what happens.\\u201d\\nWhile he is not opposed to programs that identify and serve gifted children, Lucas warns that any such effort will be gamed by more well-to-do parents, angling to get their children in, then fighting to ensure the gifted group gets better teachers, newer technology, and other advantages. Great care would be required, he says, so as not to \\u201cend up with another system for those at the top to reinforce that they belong there.\\u201d\\nWhile equity at the classroom level is important, Lubinski and others who study the gifted say that the issue goes beyond education to national competitiveness. \\u201cWe\\u2019re living in a global economy now,\\u201d Lubinski says, \\u201cand there are only very few people of any discipline who push the frontiers of knowledge forward. This is the population who you\\u2019d do well to bet on.\\u201d\\nOther countries are already making that bet. Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore have national laws requiring that children be screened for giftedness, with top scorers funneled into special programs. China is midway through a 10-year \\u201cNational Talent Development Plan\\u201d to steer bright young people into science, technology, and other in-demand fields. In a 2010 speech announcing the scheme, former President Hu Jintao called talent \\u201cthe most important resource and...a key issue that concerns the development of the Party and country.\\u201d\\nIn a democracy, such central planning may be as distasteful as the notion of shifting resources away from kids who need them. Advocates for the gifted, aware of those concerns, are trying to find ways for us to develop our own native talent without exacerbating inequality.\\nOne fix they tend to focus on is investing in early childhood education for all: Olszewski-Kubilius points out that expanding access to preschool would allow teachers to identify kids with the most potential before they even get to kindergarten. Requiring regular screening of all kids from elementary to high school would catch those whose talents emerge later than their peers\\u2019, as well as smart kids whose parents aren\\u2019t savvy enough to advocate for them.\\nOther education researchers propose gearing the entire curriculum toward the highest-achieving students, with extra time outside of class for their less-talented peers to catch up. It\\u2019s an idea that Adam Gamoran, president of the youth-focused William T. Grant Foundation and a former University of Wisconsin sociologist, says could address the issue of inequality without holding back high achievers.\\nRegardless of how we choose to deal with the gifted, it\\u2019s a challenge that seems more acute as we learn more about this population.\\n\\u201cHow many people can become an astrophysicist or a PhD in chemistry?\\u201d Lubinski says, comparing it to playing in the NFL or playing at Carnegie Hall. \\u201cWe really have to look for the best\\u2014that\\u2019s what we do in the Olympics, that\\u2019s what we do in music, and that\\u2019s what we need to with intellectual capital.\\u201d\\nAmy Crawford has written for Boston Magazine, Smithsonian, and Slate.

Other research has shown that under-stimulated gifted students quickly become bored and frustrated&mdash;especially if they come from low-income families that are not equipped to provide them with enrichment outside of school.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;What the study underscored is the tremendous amount of potential here&mdash;they&rsquo;re a national resource,&rdquo; Lubinski says. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s hard to separate the findings of this study from what we know about gifted kids in general. The genuine concern is, we know we&rsquo;re not identifying all of this population. We&rsquo;re not getting nearly enough, and we&rsquo;re losing them.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>To people more worried about kids who are falling through the cracks altogether, doing slightly less than we could for the most gifted might not seem like a pressing problem. But if the study is right that exceptional youthful ability really does correlate directly with exceptional adult achievement, then these talented young kids aren&rsquo;t just a challenge for schools and parents: they&rsquo;re also demonstrably important to America&rsquo;s future. And it means that if, in education, we focus on steering all extra money and attention toward kids who are struggling academically, or even just to the average student, we risk shortchanging the country in a different way.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;We are in a talent war, and we&rsquo;re living in a global economy now,&rdquo; Lubinski says. &ldquo;These are the people who are going to figure out all the riddles. Schizophrenia, cancer&mdash;they&rsquo;re going to fight terrorism, they&rsquo;re going to create patents and the scientific innovations that drive our economy. But they are not given a lot of opportunities in schools that are designed for typically developing kids.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>\\n<span class=\\\"span\\\" id=\\\"U731297908717Z9D\\\" style=\\\" text-transform: uppercase; ;\\\"><b class=\\\"b\\\">Given all the pressures<\\/b><\\/span> our education system faces, it seems almost indecent to worry about the travails of a small minority of very smart children. Understandably, federal and state education policy has long focused on more obvious problems that education can help address&mdash;problems such as the yawning gaps between the test scores of rich and poor students and between different racial groups. Tax dollars disproportionately go to help kids with learning disabilities and other disadvantages, because society generally agrees that they are most in need of help.<\\/p>\\n<p>In 2002, President George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act, which penalizes public schools that don&rsquo;t bring the lowest-performing students up to grade level. The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act regulates special education and provides schools with more than $11 billion annually. A provision of federal education law called Title I allocates some $14 billion to schools that have a higher proportion of students from low-income families, to pay for programs designed to keep them from falling behind.<\\/p>\\n<div class=\\\"figure\\\">\\n<img alt=\\\"\\n\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" data-fullsrc=\\\"//c.o0bg.com/rf/image_460w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/03/13/BostonGlobe.com/Ideas/Images/gifted_kids_detail.jpg\\\" src=\\\"http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_r/Boston/2011-2020/2014/03/13/BostonGlobe.com/Ideas/Images/gifted_kids_detail.r.jpg\\\"><\\/img>\\n<\\/div>\\n<p><\\/p>\\n<p>The smartest kid in class, by contrast, is not an expensive problem. A boy or girl who finishes an assignment early can be handed a book and told to read quietly while the teacher works on getting other children caught up. What would clearly be neglect if it happened to a special-needs child tends to look different if the child is gifted: Being left alone might even feel like a reward, an acknowledgment of being a fast learner.<\\/p>\\n<p>Not surprisingly, programs oriented toward gifted children get barely any federal funding. The Javits Act, the only federal law aimed at gifted students, pays for research and pilot education programs and is currently funded at $5 million, down from a peak of $11 million several years ago.<\\/p>\\n<p>Gifted students do have their own advocacy group, the National Association for Gifted Children. This coalition of parents and educators is currently pushing a bipartisan bill called the Talent Act, which would require states and school districts to set policies for gifted education and report on the performance of advanced students. (In a concession to reality, the act does not seek any new funding.) The group&rsquo;s former president, Paula Olszewski-Kubilius, says that in an ideal world the federal government would require that gifted students be identified early and would fund schools&rsquo; efforts to train teachers and provide enrichment or accelerated learning programs.<\\/p>\\n<p>Olszewski-Kubilius, an education professor at Northwestern University, considers the latest Vanderbilt finding important to the cause. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the best research we have that connects childhood giftedness with adult achievement,&rdquo; she says. She chalks up the current disparity to an otherwise well-intentioned attitude, one that seems to be ingrained in American culture.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fundamental belief, not just among educators but in general in our society&mdash;and the word &lsquo;gifted&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t help&mdash;that, well, they lucked out by virtue of genetics. They&rsquo;ve got something other people don&rsquo;t have, and so they should just be satisfied with that. They don&rsquo;t need any more.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>Research, however, suggests that they do&mdash;or at least that they benefit from extra investment. Two recent papers based on data from the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth and published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that, among young people with off-the-charts ability, those who had been given special accommodations&mdash;even modest ones, like being allowed to skip a grade, enroll in special classes, or take college-level courses in high school&mdash;went on to publish more academic papers, earn more patents, and pursue higher-level careers than their equally smart peers who didn&rsquo;t have these opportunities. In one of the studies, the Vanderbilt researchers matched students who skipped a grade with a control group of similarly smart kids who didn&rsquo;t. The grade-skippers, it turned out, were 60 percent more likely to earn doctorates or patents and more than twice as likely to get a PhD in science, math, or engineering.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;If you look at the control group&rdquo; in the grade-skipping study, says Lubinski, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;The curriculum was moving too slow, I felt bored, I was frustrated.&rsquo; Those kids still do better than the norm, but the ones who have their developmental needs met, they do much better.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>But providing these smart kids with an education that matches their abilities is not as straightforward as it sounds. Politically, it raises the fraught question of whether our education system should be in the business of identifying and segregating elite students&mdash;an idea that has been tried and rejected before, for good reasons.<\\/p>\\n<p>For most of the 20th century, schools routinely divided students into advanced, average, and remedial categories, a practice called &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; that was largely discredited by research showing it only exacerbated inequality, especially inequality linked to race and class.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;The original basis was the idea that some people are born to lead and others are born to follow, so you identify the leaders early and train them to lead,&rdquo; says Samuel Lucas, a Berkeley sociologist whose research has focused on inequality in education. Those who were groomed to be followers, he notes, consistently wound up with worse teachers, scarcer supplies, and a weaker curriculum than their more advanced peers.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to introduce stratification into the system without introducing inequality in how people get into those stratifications,&rdquo; Lucas says. &ldquo;Students at the bottom should be getting the best of resources so they can catch up. They certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be getting worse resources, and the research shows that this is what happens.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>While he is not opposed to programs that identify and serve gifted children, Lucas warns that any such effort will be gamed by more well-to-do parents, angling to get their children in, then fighting to ensure the gifted group gets better teachers, newer technology, and other advantages. Great care would be required, he says, so as not to &ldquo;end up with another system for those at the top to reinforce that they belong there.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p>\\n<span class=\\\"span\\\" id=\\\"U7312979087176EF\\\" style=\\\" text-transform: uppercase; ;\\\"><b class=\\\"b\\\">While equity<\\/b><\\/span> at the classroom level is important, Lubinski and others who study the gifted say that the issue goes beyond education to national competitiveness. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re living in a global economy now,&rdquo; Lubinski says, &ldquo;and there are only very few people of any discipline who push the frontiers of knowledge forward. This is the population who you&rsquo;d do well to bet on.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>Other countries are already making that bet. Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore have national laws requiring that children be screened for giftedness, with top scorers funneled into special programs. China is midway through a 10-year &ldquo;National Talent Development Plan&rdquo; to steer bright young people into science, technology, and other in-demand fields. In a 2010 speech announcing the scheme, former President Hu Jintao called talent &ldquo;the most important resource and...a key issue that concerns the development of the Party and country.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<p>In a democracy, such central planning may be as distasteful as the notion of shifting resources away from kids who need them. Advocates for the gifted, aware of those concerns, are trying to find ways for us to develop our own native talent without exacerbating inequality.<\\/p>\\n<p>One fix they tend to focus on is investing in early childhood education for all: Olszewski-Kubilius points out that expanding access to preschool would allow teachers to identify kids with the most potential before they even get to kindergarten. Requiring regular screening of all kids from elementary to high school would catch those whose talents emerge later than their peers&rsquo;, as well as smart kids whose parents aren&rsquo;t savvy enough to advocate for them.<\\/p>\\n<p>Other education researchers propose gearing the entire curriculum toward the highest-achieving students, with extra time outside of class for their less-talented peers to catch up. It&rsquo;s an idea that Adam Gamoran, president of the youth-focused William T. Grant Foundation and a former University of Wisconsin sociologist, says could address the issue of inequality without holding back high achievers.<\\/p>\\n<p>Regardless of how we choose to deal with the gifted, it&rsquo;s a challenge that seems more acute as we learn more about this population.<\\/p>\\n<p>&ldquo;How many people can become an astrophysicist or a PhD in chemistry?&rdquo; Lubinski says, comparing it to playing in the NFL or playing at Carnegie Hall. &ldquo;We really have to look for the best&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we do in the Olympics, that&rsquo;s what we do in music, and that&rsquo;s what we need to with intellectual capital.&rdquo;<\\/p>\\n<\\/content><tagline>\\n<em>Amy Crawford has written for Boston Magazine, Smithsonian, and Slate.

I started my \\u201ccareer\\u201d at the beginning of the Great Recession.\\nLike many in my generation, I entered the work force with a nonexistent job security. The bankruptcy bailout lingered into a sluggish hiring freeze in all fields. Few businesses were willing to take a chance on a Millennial. Your \\u201cvision\\u201d is not needed, go away. The economy would love to see the Millennials go away. They do not want to hear our whining as they call it. They don\\u2019t want to see an optimistic 20-something enthusiastically bounce into the office with a new idea. They don\\u2019t want to see a change. No new people, the door is closed, good luck.\\nEvery 20-something can testify to the resume black hole. Did you include enough buzzwords or keywords in your resume? Then it is your fault you do not have a job. The lack of empathy for Millennials in the work force is very telling. The economy needs us to take out loans from bailed out banks. They need us to buy cars from the bailed out \\u201cBig 3\\u2033 auto companies. They need us to buy a house in an underwater market. They want us to be the ones who save the delinquent economy, bring in back to its glory days, at our expense. They want us to stay naive children and be guided into making horrendous financial decisions at our own peril\\nAfter college I spent a year without a job. Despite my previous experience in the service sector I could not find employment as a waitress. I could not get a job stocking merchandise in retail. Every job was closed off to me. I lived in a small town and I was screwed. In a last ditch effort I hopped a Greyhound bus out of the area. All I took with me was a bag full of clothes and a messenger bag containing my laptop. It was not the first or last time I would risk it all to move to another state.\\nAfter a month I started a waitress job at an IHOP. After a couple of months the phone calls endlessly persued me. Are you going to pay us back? You can put your student loans in deferral for another year. Call us back at XXX-XXX-XXXX, we can work with you. I got calls at work, from multiple anonymous numbers, they even called extended members of my family. Having to explain to my seventy year old grandmother, why student loan collectors were calling her, was a difficult conversation.\\nGrandmother: \\u201cSweetie, you need to pay your debts.\\u201dMe: \\u201cI know, grandma.\\u201dGrandmother: \\u201cWhy did you borrow money you could not repay?\\u201dMe: \\u201cI thought I could repay it until the bailouts happened.\\u201dGrandmother: \\u201cThat is no excuse. You need to repay them.\\u201d\\nAfter that conversation I was enraged. I refused to let the student loan collectors violate my privacy. Bothering me was an annoyance. Bothering my elderly grandmother was intolerable. In that moment I refused to play their little game any longer. To me, being a student loan debtor did not equal the treatment of deadbeat. I made the decision to default on my student loans. I made the decision to not accumulate additional interest. I was not going to let my debtors earn more money by charging me interest over a decade.\\nAfter refusing to make a payment or allow a deferral the threats started. We are going to garnish your wages. Ok, I don\\u2019t make much money anyway. We are going to ruin your credit. Ok, I don\\u2019t want to take out additional debt anyway. We will confiscate your tax refunds. Ok, I only see that money once a year anyway. We will guarantee you will never be able to take out a mortgage. Ok, I can\\u2019t afford a house anyway. We will guarantee you can never get another car loan. Ok, my car is in excellent condition with less than 100,000 miles.\\nThe desperation of pleads with debt collectors got stranger. In the last four years since I defaulted on my loans I was never asked to pay them. I was never asked to set up a payment schedule. The calls focused entirely on getting them out of default. They were not interested in the loans being repaid. They just did not want them in default because they could not charge me interest. All the calls I currently receive focus on putting them back in deferral.\\nIn the last four years I have had my wages garnished and my tax returns confiscated. My credit was initially ruined until I started rebuilding my credit worthiness. I have not paid any additional interest on my original loan since going into default. I defaulted on my loans, now they are half way paid off. With no interest being charged I am on my way to being officially debt free. I defaulted on my student loan and I am not sorry.

 "{\"icon\":\"http://tiamat.tsotech.com/static/logoicons/tiamat-114.png\",\"author\":\"Brian Hauer\",\"text\":\"4K is so not for programmers.\\nToday's cheap 4K displays are not up to snuff. All of those pixels do not compensate for mousing at 30 frames per second and it doesn't matter if you have millions of pixels if the colors are all wrong. So we returned our Seiki 4K televisions and switched back to our trusty 19-inch ViewSonic monitors. Some of us took the 4K televisions home and installed them in our living rooms, where 4K rightfully belongs.\\nWe're not crazy. 4K is for programmers, not couch potatoes.\\nThere are serious weaknesses with the current batch of 4K displays, from the still-not-available HDMI 2 specification, to shortsighted design and marketing decisions such as targeting the living room first. These limitations are not a matter of technology, making them acutely frustrating to an informed buyer. We should not suffer these failings; we should not be beta-testers for a clueless industry.\\nStill, the cost-benefit analysis is all too simple: the cost is low, and the benefit is high, despite the failings.\\nI was told that multiple internets (is Internet2 still a thing?) would enjoy a follow-up to my earlier post. So here it is.\\nWould we do it again?\\nHaving used these displays for about two months, do we have any regrets?\\nNo. We'd buy them today had we not already bought them in January. The price is simply too low and our need for an upgrade was too high to hesitate. With luck, superior displays will hit the market this year. But instead of waiting, we're happy to have huge displays right now.\\nAs for weaknesses, two months have confirmed some that were known and uncovered some others.\\n30 frames per second sucks\\nThe principal weakness of today's 4K displays is the use of HDMI 1.4, which is limited to 30 frames per second at 3840x2160. The marketing material for the Seiki television is a bit confusing. The box prominently says \\\"120Hz,\\\" which is in fact available at low resolutions. But at the maximum resolution of 3840x2160\\u2014the resolution you are going to use if you connect this television to your computer\\u2014HDMI 1.4 limits refreshes to 30 per second (\\\"30Hz\\\").\\nIt's important to understand that 30Hz on an LCD is nothing like 30Hz from a strobe light or a CRT. 30 frame updates are sent to the monitor per second, but there is no flicker. The screen is not going dark between frames. Still, with so few frames per second, routine computer user interface mechanics such as aiming with a mouse pointer or scrolling a window can be choppy and frustrating.\\nLet me be clear: 30 frames per second sucks. All of my colleagues and I would prefer displays with 60 frames per second or better, all else being equal. But all else is not equal, which means that while 30 frames per second is more bothersome to some than others, we all tolerate it.\\nI'm optimistic that affordable displays with HDMI 2 or modern DisplayPort inputs will arrive soon, along with the necessary GPUs. 4K at 60Hz will be even more compelling than today's options.\\nBut do I want to postpone working with this many pixels to save $500? No thanks.\\nThe colors aren't just bad, they are broken\\nIf you've looked into low-cost 4K televisions such as the Seiki, you're probably aware of ample criticism about the color accuracy and limited adjustments of these displays. While a firmware patch mercifully grants backlight dimming, the best we can achieve in color calibration is disappointing to anyone who uses the phrase \\\"color calibration.\\\" You know who you are.\\nWeak color accuracy is just the start. The Seiki has a defect in how it processes some bitmaps. Certain pixel configurations cause bizarre rendering failures. The defect can be seen in gradients, for instance on blogs with gradient backgrounds (who would make such a thing?).\\nThe following composition compares the Seiki (left) displaying a background gradient from this blog, the same gradient displayed on a Dell U3011 (middle), and the source bitmap (right).\\nAt first I suspected a bizarre interoperability failure between the display driver and the browsers' gradient algorithm, but this effect is observed even in a screenshot. The defect is not in the bitmap itself; it's simply how the Seiki television displays the bitmap.\\nBut here's the thing. Take a look at how awful the color accuracy is for programming. Again, Seiki at left; Dell U3011 in middle; and zoomed bitmap at right.\\nOh wait a second, that's not too bad. I can actually read the code at the left.\\nIn most cases, the defect is subtle. For a web developer, this defect can be annoying but as a known defect, it's not particularly hurtful to productivity. (Note that our workstations also have small secondary monitors that can be useful when absolutely necessary to confirm such artifacts are not our fault.)\\nThis defect sucks. Do I want a display that doesn't do this? Yes. Do I want my money back and a smaller display? No.\\nSleep mode is completely wrong\\nIf you have secondary monitors, do not allow your Seiki to go to sleep unless you have a good window manager. From the computer's perspective, when the Seiki is asleep or off, it is disconnected. Power off your Seiki, and your computer will move all of your applications to your other monitor. Power it back on, and you've got a new empty workspace.\\nThere are hardware workarounds for this behavior, but none we have been able to verify. Our preferred workaround is software: use either a tiling window manager or a window manager that allows you to save and restore window positions. Just press a hotkey after powering up the Seiki and you're back to work.\\nAs I mentioned previously, the display also doesn't wake up via DPMS. This is a bit annoying, but ultimately it's merely inconvenient to have to press the power button.\\nAn odd bit: at my house, I have an old Panasonic plasma in my living room that behaves like a monitor (it has DPMS support and no speakers) and meanwhile on the desktop, we have a Seiki television with speakers but no DPMS.\\nMiscellaneous problems\\nA few other minor problems:\\nThe on-board audio capability is a bit flaky. Most of us aren't using the speakers, but those who have say that the volume level is sometimes unresponsive (fixed at mute, for example) until they reboot their PC. This might be a problem with the nVidia HDMI audio though. We have not investigated this.\\nWe have not yet captured the detailed steps to get Linux working at 3840x2160 on our hardware. We needed to set up a new workstation recently and it took several hours and caused great anguish, suffering, and maybe even cursing. The Mac OS X and Windows folks have had no issues and use this as cause to laugh at the Linux users.\\nThe factory settings have an unsharp mask enabled. As Chris Cardinal points out below in the comments, that default is unfit for a computer display since it wreaks havoc with text and everything else. I would never even enable such a filter on a television, so this default is plain bad regardless of context. Adjust the \\\"Sharpness\\\" setting to zero to yield an unfiltered view.\\nI am a total noob at blogging for fame and cash monies, so I did not have the Amazon link wired up for mad referral loots. I've since fixed it, too late of course.\\nSeiki never contacted me to offer early access to 60Hz 4K models. And that has been my ulterior motive all along!\\nThe good stuff\\n3840x2160. Period. Full stop. Enough said. But I'll elaborate.\\n3840x2160 is so good that it significantly outweighs the downsides above and even potential downsides we've not yet encountered, such as unknown long-term reliability. We have about twenty of these displays and none were dead on arrival. Most have no dead pixels, but a few have a small number.\\nWe don't have any scientific or pseudo-scientific measure of the displays' bearing on our productivity. All we have are anecdotes. And anecdotally, none of us would switch back to a small monitor. Mouse lag caused by the 30Hz refresh rate is our chief complaint, but none consider it worse than the alternative: less display.\\nSome quotes from colleagues:\\n\\u201cAs expected, I don't really care about the not-great color accuracy.\\u201d\\n\\u201cAs expected, I do care about the not-great color accuracy. Although, since I don't do photo processing here, I don't care as much.\\u201d\\n\\u201cMouse lag at 30Hz is still annoying.\\u201d\\n\\u201cMouse lag is annoying, but it became more tolerable than I expected. I would not go back. I miss this display when I use my home computer.\\u201d\\n\\u201cMouse lag would be a bit less annoying if windows had slightly larger grab areas on their edges.\\u201d\\n\\u201cTry a tiling window manager.\\u201d\\n\\u201cI'm using Windows.\\u201d\\n\\u201cGet a real OS.\\u201d\\nOverall, we strongly feel the Seikis have been a productivity boost. This may be dismissed as a placebo, but on the other hand, perhaps greater screen real estate genuinely increases programmer productivity. If nothing else, it appears to increase programmer happiness and that probably translates to productivity somewhere down the line.\\nWorth it.\\nStill, if you have an 8K display I can install on my desktop, drop me a line. I'm serious. Very serious. 8K serious. Those Internet2 guys probably have 8K displays.

All of those pixels do not compensate for mousing at 30 frames per second and it doesn't matter if you have millions of pixels if the colors are all wrong.  So we returned our Seiki 4K televisions and switched back to our trusty 19-inch ViewSonic monitors.  Some of us took the 4K televisions home and installed them in our living rooms, where 4K rightfully belongs.<p><\\/p><p><\\/p>We're not crazy.  <a href=\\\"http://tiamat.tsotech.com/4k-is-for-programmers\\\">4K <i>is<\\/i> for programmers<\\/a>, not couch potatoes.<p><\\/p>There are serious weaknesses with the current batch of 4K displays, from the still-not-available HDMI 2 specification, to shortsighted design and marketing decisions such as targeting the living room first.  These limitations are not a matter of technology, making them acutely frustrating to an informed buyer.  We should not suffer these failings; we should not be beta-testers for a clueless industry.<p><\\/p>Still, the cost-benefit analysis is all too simple: the <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DOPGO2G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DOPGO2G&linkCode=as2&tag=tiamat-20\\\">cost is low<\\/a>, and the benefit is high, despite the failings.<p><\\/p>I was told that multiple internets (is Internet2 still a thing?) would <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/frankamp/status/443828000564342784\\\">enjoy a follow-up<\\/a> to my earlier post.  So here it is.<p><\\/p><span class=\\\"fi\\\"><img alt=\\\"Some of the Seiki televisions in our office\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" src=\\\"http://tiamat.tsotech.com/images/weekend-televisions.jpg\\\" title=\\\"The televisions are so large that the people are hidden.  Or, this is a weekend.\\\"><\\/img><\\/span><p><\\/p><h1>Would we do it again?<\\/h1>\\nHaving used these displays for about two months, do we have any regrets?<p><\\/p>No.  We'd buy them today had we not already bought them in January.  The price is simply too low and our need for an upgrade was too high to hesitate.  With luck, superior displays will hit the market this year.  But instead of waiting, we're happy to have huge displays right now.<p><\\/p>As for weaknesses, two months have confirmed some that were known and uncovered some others.<p><\\/p><h1>30 frames per second sucks<\\/h1>\\nThe principal weakness of today's 4K displays is the use of HDMI 1.4, which is limited to 30 frames per second at 3840x2160.  The marketing material for the Seiki television is a bit confusing.  The box prominently says &quot;120Hz,&quot; which is in fact available at low resolutions.  But at the maximum resolution of 3840x2160&mdash;the resolution you are going to use if you connect this television to your computer&mdash;HDMI 1.4 limits refreshes to 30 per second (&quot;30Hz&quot;).<p><\\/p>It's important to understand that 30Hz on an LCD is nothing like 30Hz from a strobe light or a CRT.  30 frame updates are sent to the monitor per second, but there is no flicker.  The screen is not going dark between frames.  Still, with so few frames per second, routine computer user interface mechanics such as aiming with a mouse pointer or scrolling a window can be choppy and frustrating.<p><\\/p>Let me be clear: 30 frames per second sucks.  All of my colleagues and I would prefer displays with 60 frames per second or better, all else being equal.  But all else is not equal, which means that while 30 frames per second is more bothersome to some than others, we all tolerate it.<p><\\/p>I'm optimistic that affordable displays with HDMI 2 or modern DisplayPort inputs will arrive soon, along with the necessary GPUs.  4K at 60Hz will be even more compelling than today's options.<p><\\/p>But do I want to postpone working with this many pixels to save $500?  No thanks.<p><\\/p><h1>The colors aren't just bad, they are broken<\\/h1>\\nIf you've looked into low-cost 4K televisions such as the Seiki, you're probably aware of ample criticism about the color accuracy and limited adjustments of these displays.  While a firmware patch mercifully grants backlight dimming, the best we can achieve in color calibration is disappointing to anyone who uses the phrase &quot;color calibration.&quot;  You know who you are.<p><\\/p>Weak color accuracy is just the start.  The Seiki has a defect in how it processes some bitmaps.  Certain pixel configurations cause bizarre rendering failures.  The defect can be seen in gradients, for instance on blogs with gradient backgrounds (who would make such a thing?).<p><\\/p>The following composition compares the Seiki (left) displaying a background gradient from this blog, the same gradient displayed on a Dell U3011 (middle), and the source bitmap (right).<p><\\/p><span class=\\\"fi\\\"><img alt=\\\"Comparison of Seiki and Dell displays rendering a gradient\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" src=\\\"http://tiamat.tsotech.com/images/seiki-gradient.jpg\\\" title=\\\"The Seiki sometimes exhibits bizarre rendering artifacts\\\"><\\/img><\\/span><p><\\/p>At first I suspected a bizarre interoperability failure between the display driver and the browsers' gradient algorithm, but this effect is observed even in a screenshot.  The defect is not in the bitmap itself; it's simply how the Seiki television displays the bitmap.<p><\\/p>But here's the thing.  Take a look at how awful the color accuracy is for programming.  Again, Seiki at left; Dell U3011 in middle; and zoomed bitmap at right.<p><\\/p><span class=\\\"fi\\\"><img alt=\\\"Comparison of Seiki and Dell displays rendering source code in an editor\\\" class=\\\"diffbot_image\\\" src=\\\"http://tiamat.tsotech.com/images/seiki-code.jpg\\\" title=\\\"FixedSys for life!\\\"><\\/img><\\/span><p><\\/p>Oh wait a second, that's not too bad.

 "{\"author\":\"Rebecca Smith\",\"text\":\"The U.S. could suffer a coast-to-coast blackout if saboteurs knocked out just nine of the country's 55,000 electric-transmission substations on a scorching summer day, according to a previously unreported federal analysis.\\nThe study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concluded that coordinated attacks in each of the nation's three separate electric systems could cause the entire power network to collapse, people familiar with the research said.\\nA small number of the country's substations play an outsize role in keeping power flowing across large regions. The FERC analysis indicates that knocking out nine of those key substations could plunge the country into darkness for weeks, if not months.\\n\\\"This would be an event of unprecedented proportions,\\\" said Ross Baldick, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.\\nNo federal rules require utilities to protect vital substations except those at nuclear power plants. Regulators recently said they would consider imposing security standards.\\nFERC last year used software to model the electric system's performance under the stress of losing important substations. The substations use large power transformers to boost the voltage of electricity so it can move long distances and then to reduce the voltage to a usable level as the electricity nears homes and businesses.\\nThe agency's so-called power-flow analysis found that different sets of nine big substations produced similar results. The Wall Street Journal isn't publishing the list of 30 critical substations studied by FERC. The commission declined to discuss the analysis or to release its contents.\\nSome federal officials said the conclusions might overstate the grid's vulnerability.\\nElectric systems are designed to be resilient and it would be difficult for attackers to disable many locations, said David Ortiz, an Energy Department deputy assistant secretary who was briefed on the FERC study. The agency's findings nevertheless had value \\\"as a way of starting a conversation on physical security,\\\" he said.\\nThe study's results have been known for months by people at federal agencies, Congress and the White House, who were briefed by then-FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff and others at the commission. by the Journal last month, Mr. Wellinghoff was concerned about a shooting attack on a California substation last April, which he said could be a dress rehearsal for additional assaults.\\n\\\"There are probably less than 100 critical high voltage substations on our grid in this country that need to be protected from a physical attack,\\\" he said by email this week. \\\"It is neither a monumental task, nor is it an inordinate sum of money that would be required to do so.\\\" Mr. Wellinghoff left FERC in November and is a partner at law firm Stoel Rives LLP in San Francisco.\\nFERC has given the industry until early June to propose new standards for the security of critical facilities, such as substations.\\nExecutives at several big utilities declined to discuss the risks to substations but said they are increasing spending on security. Virginia-based Dominion Resources Inc., for example, said it planned to spend $300 million to $500 million within seven years to harden its facilities.\\nA memo prepared at FERC in late June for Mr. Wellinghoff before he briefed senior officials made several urgent points. \\\"Destroy nine interconnection substations and a transformer manufacturer and the entire United States grid would be down for at least 18 months, probably longer,\\\" said the memo, which was reviewed by the Journal. That lengthy outage is possible for several reasons, including that only a handful of U.S. factories build transformers.\\nThe California attack \\\"demonstrates that it does not require sophistication to do significant damage to the U.S. grid,\\\" according to the memo, which was written by Leonard Tao, FERC's director of external affairs. Mr. Tao said his function was to help Mr. Wellinghoff simplify his report on the analysis.\\nThe memo reflected a belief by some people at the agency that an attack-related blackout could be extraordinarily long, in part because big transformers and other equipment are hard to replace. Also, each of the three regional electric systems\\u2014the West, the East and Texas\\u2014have limited interconnections, making it hard for them to help each other in an emergency.\\nSome experts said other simulations that are widely used in the electricity industry produced similar results as the FERC analysis.\\n\\\"This study used a relatively simplified model, but other models come to the same conclusion,\\\" said A.P. \\\"Sakis\\\" Meliopoulos, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. He estimated it would take \\\"a slightly larger number\\\" of substation attacks to cause a U.S.-wide blackout.\\nIn its modeling, FERC studied what would happen if various combinations of substations were crippled in the three electrical systems that serve the contiguous U.S. The agency concluded the systems could go dark if as few as nine locations were knocked out: four in the East, three in the West and two in Texas, people with knowledge of the analysis said.\\nThe actual number of locations that would have to be knocked out to spawn a massive blackout would vary depending on available generation resources, energy demand, which is highest on hot days, and other factors, experts said. Because it is difficult to build new transmission routes, existing big substations are becoming more crucial to handling electricity.\\nIn last April's attack at PG&E Corp.'s Metcalf substation, gunmen shot 17 large transformers over 19 minutes before fleeing in advance of police. The state grid operator was able to avoid any blackouts.\\nThe Metcalf substation sits near a freeway outside San Jose, Calif. Some experts worry that substations farther from cities could face longer attacks because of their distance from police. Many sites aren't staffed and are protected by little more than chain-link fences and cameras.\\nWhile the prospect of a nationwide blackout because of sabotage might seem remote, small equipment failures have led to widespread power outages. In September 2011, for example, a failed transmission line in Arizona set off a chain reaction that created an outage affecting millions of people in the state and Southern California.\\nSabotage could wreak worse havoc, experts said.\\n\\\"The power grid, built over many decades in a benign environment, now faces a range of threats it was never designed to survive,\\\" said Paul Stockton, a former assistant secretary of defense and president of risk-assessment firm Cloud Peak Analytics. \\\"That's got to be the focus going forward.\\\"\\nWrite to Rebecca Smith at\",\"title\":\"U.S. Risks National Blackout From Small-Scale Attack\",\"images\":[{\"primary\":\"true\",\"url\":\"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/P1-BP436_GRIDCO_G_20140312184312.jpg\"}],\"html\":\"<div class=\\\"zonedModule\\\" data-module-id=\\\"undefined\\\" data-module-name=\\\"resp.module.article.articleBody\\\">  <article class=\\\"module articleBody\\\" id=\\\"articleBody\\\" itemprop=\\\"articleBody\\\"> <div class=\\\"module rich-media-inset inset-group view full-width imageFormat-G\\\" style=\\\"border-top:0\\\"> <div class=\\\"inset-tree\\\"> <div class=\\\"inset-content inset-single-image-large\\\"> <div class=\\\"insettipUnit \\\"> <div class=\\\"inset-image-box \\\"> <img class=\\\"inset-thumbnail-small diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"469\\\" src=\\\"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/P1-BP436_GRIDCO_G_20140312184312.jpg\\\" width=\\\"555\\\"><\\/img> <\\/div> <p class=\\\"targetCaption-video\\\"> <span class=\\\"i-credit\\\"><\\/span> <\\/p> <\\/div> <\\/div> <\\/div><\\/div> <p>The U.S. could suffer a coast-to-coast blackout if saboteurs knocked out just nine of the country's 55,000 electric-transmission substations on a scorching summer day, according to a previously unreported federal analysis.<\\/p> <p>The study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concluded that coordinated attacks in each of the nation's three separate electric systems could cause the entire power network to collapse, people familiar with the research said.<\\/p>  <p>A small number of the country's substations play an outsize role in keeping power flowing across large regions.

That lengthy outage is possible for several reasons, including that only a handful of U.S. factories <a class=\\\"icon none\\\" href=\\\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304071004579409631825984744\\\" target=\\\"_new\\\">build transformers<\\/a>. <\\/p> <p>The California attack &quot;demonstrates that it does not require sophistication to do significant damage to the U.S. grid,&quot; according to the memo, which was written by Leonard Tao, FERC's director of external affairs. Mr. Tao said his function was to help Mr. Wellinghoff simplify his report on the analysis.<\\/p> <p>The memo reflected a belief by some people at the agency that an attack-related blackout could be extraordinarily long, in part because big transformers and other equipment are hard to replace. Also, each of the three regional electric systems&mdash;the West, the East and Texas&mdash;have limited interconnections, making it hard for them to help each other in an emergency.<\\/p> <p>Some experts said other simulations that are widely used in the electricity industry produced similar results as the FERC analysis.<\\/p> <p>&quot;This study used a relatively simplified model, but other models come to the same conclusion,&quot; said A.P. &quot;Sakis&quot; Meliopoulos, professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. He estimated it would take &quot;a slightly larger number&quot; of substation attacks to cause a U.S.-wide blackout.<\\/p> <p>In its modeling, FERC studied what would happen if various combinations of substations were crippled in the three electrical systems that serve the contiguous U.S. The agency concluded the systems could go dark if as few as nine locations were knocked out: four in the East, three in the West and two in Texas, people with knowledge of the analysis said.<\\/p> <p>The actual number of locations that would have to be knocked out to spawn a massive blackout would vary depending on available generation resources, energy demand, which is highest on hot days, and other factors, experts said. Because it is difficult to build new transmission routes, existing big substations are becoming more crucial to handling electricity.<\\/p> <p>In last April's attack at <a class=\\\"t-company\\\" href=\\\"http://quotes.wsj.com/PCG\\\">PG&amp;E<\\/a> Corp.'s <span class=\\\"article-chiclet up\\\" data-channel-currency=\\\"$\\\" data-channel-last-price=\\\"44.31\\\" data-channel-path=\\\"/quotes/nls/pcg\\\" data-country-code=\\\"US\\\" data-ticker-code=\\\"PCG\\\" data-utc-offset-hours=\\\"-4\\\">   <\\/span> Metcalf substation, gunmen shot 17 large transformers over 19 minutes before fleeing in advance of police. The state grid operator was able to avoid any blackouts.<\\/p> <p>The Metcalf substation sits near a freeway outside San Jose, Calif. Some experts worry that substations farther from cities could face longer attacks because of their distance from police. Many sites aren't staffed and are protected by little more than chain-link fences and cameras.<\\/p> <p>While the prospect of a nationwide blackout because of sabotage might seem remote, small equipment failures have led to widespread power outages. In September 2011, for example, a failed transmission line in Arizona set off a chain reaction that created an outage affecting millions of people in the state and Southern California.<\\/p> <p>Sabotage could wreak worse havoc, experts said.<\\/p> <p>&quot;The power grid, built over many decades in a benign environment, now faces a range of threats it was never designed to survive,&quot; said Paul Stockton, a former assistant secretary of defense and president of risk-assessment firm Cloud Peak Analytics. &quot;That's got to be the focus going forward.&quot;<\\/p> <p> <strong>Write to <\\/strong> Rebecca Smith at  <\\/p> <div class=\\\"cxense\\\" id=\\\"cX-scrim-ad\\\"><\\/div> <\\/article> <\\/div>\",\"date\":\"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 23:03:00 GMT\",\"type\":\"article\",\"url\":\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304020104579433670284061220\"}", 
 "{\"icon\":\"http://bryanbraun.com/sites/all/themes/rebrauned/images/favicon_176.ico\",\"text\":\"One of my favorite classic screensavers from back in the day was \\\"Flying Toasters,\\\" a part of the After Dark bundle.\\nAhhh. Those were the good old days.\\nAs a front-end developer, I started wondering if you could recreate the magic using only CSS. The answer, as you probably guessed is, yes, you can (you can see it in action here). Here's how I went about doing it.\\nGetting a character to move isn't new, and one of the classic techniques is to put together a \\\"sprite sheet,\\\" which is an image that contains all the individual frames of your animation.\\nYou may have used sprites to capture the hover and active states of your menu buttons, but you can also use them for animations. In my case, I needed an image with the toaster in different phases of flapping. Here's what I came up with:\\nTo give it the appearance of motion, we need to hop rapidly from one frame to another. We do this by creating a box with a fixed width and height and putting in our image as a background image.\\n<!-- the HTML --> <div class=\\\"toaster\\\"><\\/div> /* the CSS */ .toaster { position: absolute; background: url(/sites/default/files/toaster-sprite.gif); width: 64px; height: 64px; }\\nNow we want to move the position of that background image between each of the sprite frames. We do this by defining some CSS keyframes (you'll want vendor prefixes on many of these rules for cross-browser compatibility, but for the sake of brevity, I'm leaving them out).\\n/** * Our image is 256px wide so this rule tells the image to shift * to the right the full length of the image. */ @keyframes flap { from { background-position: 0px; } to { background-position: -256px; } }\\nBy themselves, keyframes won't do anything. You need a CSS rule to call them with the animation property.\\n/* This runs the animation named 'flap' over a period of 0.4 sec. */ .animated { animation: flap 0.4s; }\\nBut this won't really work. First, the background image will slide constantly, when what we want it to do is jump: 1st frame, 2nd frame, 3rd frame, 4th frame. Second, the animation will only run once by default, and we want it to run constantly. Finally once the animation runs once, we want it to run once in reverse, so the wings flap back up. You can look up the values that define these behaviors, but here's what it looks like when we add them in:\\n<!-- update the HTML --> <div class=\\\"toaster animated\\\"><\\/div> .animated { animation: flap .4s steps(4) infinite alternate; }\\nYou can see a demonstration of it working in this Codepen embed:\\nStep 2: Fly across the screen with translate()\\nWith the flapping part done, we just need to move it across the screen. The toasters fly from the top-right to the bottom left, and we could choose to animate this by changing the value of z-index or by using a newer function called translate(). According to the fine folks at HTML5Rocks, animating translate() is more performant than z-index, so we'll go with that.\\n/* Position our toaster just off the screen at the upper right */ .p1 { right: 10%; top: -10%; } /** * Define keyframes to translate it to the bottom left. * We'll use -1600px since that will be wider, and certainly taller, * than most standard screens. */ @keyframes fly { from { transform: translate(0, 0); } to { transform: translate(-1600px, 1600px); } } /* Update our animation to include our translate() keyframes. */ .animated { animation: flap .4s steps(4) infinite alternate, fly 10s linear infinite; } <!-- update the HTML --> <div class=\\\"toaster animated p1\\\"><\\/div>\\nNow we have a single flying toaster. Whoo hoo!\\nStep 3: Add in some flying toast\\nBut what's a flying toaster without toast?\\nAnimating the toast is easier because it doesn't need to flap. We just get a single image of toast and move it across the screen. In fact, we can borrow the same position and keyframes we defined for the toaster.\\n/* Set up our toast object */ .toast { position: absolute; width: 64px; height: 64px; background-image: url(\\\"/sites/default/files/toast1.gif\\\"); } /** * Toast-specific animation (needed since our toast doesn't flap) * Notice that I added a 6s delay, so it comes after the toaster. */ .tst1 { animation: fly 10s 6s linear infinite; } <!-- Toast HTML --> <div class=\\\"toast tst1 p1\\\"><\\/div>\\nAs you can see, the code is very similar to that of the toaster.\\nWith all the hard work done, we just need to throw a whole bunch more toasters and toast in there.\\nWe want them to come onto the screen from all different places, so we'll define several more starting positions (similar to & ).\\n.p6 { right: -2%; top: -10%; } .p7 { right: 10%; top: -12%; } .p8 { right: 20%; top: -18%; } .p9 { right: 30%; top: -13%; } .p10 { right: 40%; top: -17%; } /* etc. */\\nWe'll want a few waves of toasters to keep the screen covered while we wait for the first round to repeat again, so we'll add more animations (which I'll call , , etc.) with a starting delay on them. We also want toasters flying at different speeds and ones with wings flapping out of sync with the other toasters. For that, we'll define even more animations with various adjustments to the properties.\\n.t1 { animation: flap .2s steps(4) infinite alternate, fly 10s linear infinite; } .t2 { animation: flap .2s steps(4) infinite alternate-reverse, fly 16s linear infinite; } .t3 { animation: flap .2s steps(4) infinite alternate, fly 24s linear infinite; } /* etc. */\\nWhen it's all done, we have a big stack of toasters and toast, starting at various positions, running various animations:\\n<div class=\\\"toaster t1 p6\\\"><\\/div> <div class=\\\"toaster t3 p7\\\"><\\/div> <div class=\\\"toast tst1 p8\\\"><\\/div> <div class=\\\"toaster t2 p9\\\"><\\/div> <div class=\\\"toaster t1 p10\\\"><\\/div> <!-- etc. -->\\nFinally we have it: the flying toasters screensaver.\\nI've put the source up on Github, if you want to take a look. It's part of a whole set of After Dark screensavers that I've animated with CSS (including Fish, Warp, , , and others). Definitely check them out, if you miss that part of the 90s.\\n\\nWhen you really look at it, most interactive web applications like Facebook, Hotmail, and even Google Docs are really just forms. You put in values, click submit, it interacts with a database, code runs, and you see results. Drupal is no exception. Some forms are longer than otherscough cough, modules pagebut they are forms none-the-less. So naturally, by replacing Drupal's default form elements with newer, more modern alternatives, we can make a big impact on Drupal's user experience. If that's your goal, here are some options worth looking into:\\nBy default, Drupal gives you three basic multi-select options: checkboxes, autocomplete, and select lists. These can get the job done, but each one has weaknesses. Here you can see each option, its pros/cons, and alternatives for improving the experience.\\nIt's too slow to act like instant search. For tagging, you cannot see all your available options. Comma-delimited autocomplete isn't a common pattern.\\nCommand-click is unintuitive. Cannot see all selected terms at once. Small space to operate in. Unselecting terms is difficult. Difference between 'highlighted' and 'selected' is ambiguous.\\nIt may not come with Drupal core, but odds are that you have the Webform module installed on your site. With content-creators building forms and users filling them out, a few field improvements can go a long way.\\nThe Options Element and Select or other modules provide developer tools you can use to improve the forms in other modules as well, so if you're a module developer, you may want to take advantage of that.\\nThe web has charged ahead since the last release of Drupal, and HTML5 supports many new features that Drupal 6 and 7 still lack. Here are some notable modules you can use to incorporate these improvements.\\nThe Elements module provides developer tools instead of widgets you can add through the UI, but it's still nice to have modern form elements easily available to developers. You can also try out one of and see if there's one that suits your needs.\\nWith , and , there's a lot of progress in this space. In the mean time, these modules will take you far.\\n\\nMatt Cutts, an engineer at Google, spoke at this year's TED conference. Physically, he looks just like you'd expect a software engineer to look: Rather portly, with glasses and his brown hair parted to one side. You'd never guess that he had scaled Mt. Kilimanjaro (among other impressive feats).\\nHis secret? Try something new for 30 days*.\\nHe found that you can make yourself do anything for 30 days. If you really stink, you just keep doing it. If you don't like it, you can stop on the 31st day and never do it again. After trying this, he realized that he was capable of much more than he originally thought. What's more, trying new things gave him confidence to pursue more difficult things. Line upon line, he grew by trying new things he never thought he'd be able to do. Fundamentally, he had adopted a \\\"growth mindset\\\".\\nStanford Psychologist and author Carol Dweck has done extensive research on how we perceive talent and skill. This article from Stanford Magazine discusses differences between those with a growth mindset and those with a fixed mindset. It reads:\\n\\\"Take a group of adults and ask them to draw a self-portrait. Most Americans think of drawing as a gift they don\\u2019t have, and their portraits look no better than a child\\u2019s scribbles. But put them in a well-designed class... and the resulting portraits look so skilled it\\u2019s hard to believe they\\u2019re the work of the same 'talentless' individuals. The belief that you can\\u2019t improve stunts achievement.\\\"\\nThe essence of the growth mindset is that knowledge and skill is dynamic and malleable. People who adopt it believe that their capacities are expandable. They enjoy challenges, seeing them as opportunities to stretch and grow. Others who adopt a fixed mindset prefer to credit innate ability. They believe that natural talent is the best indicator of future success. They say things like \\\"I wish I could understand technology\\\", or \\\"I'm not a people person\\\".\\nAnd they are wrong.\\nThey can understand technology. They could be a 'people person'. One BYU article, The Growth Mentality, discusses learning from a neuroscience perspective. With each thing we learn, we physically grow new neural pathways in our brain. From a biological perspective, the brain develops like a muscle that grows stronger with exercise. While it is true that some start out with more talent than others, natural talent is only a small part of the equation. Consider the graph below:\\nThe red line represents somebody initially more talented than the blue line. However, blue (who has a growth-mindset), embraces learning to eventually become more skilled than his red compadre (who has a fixed mindset). Far from a pipe dream, this is a real outcome that has been exemplified by Michael Jordan, Thomas Edison, and other \\\"famous failures\\\". Consider the statement made by Heber J. Grant:\\n\\\"That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do is increased\\\" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1901, 63).\\nThis quote lines right up with the concept of The Sticky Platform. Hard things aren't hard to the people who learn how to do them. And with the resources we have today, there is nothing preventing us from becoming an ubermensch. We can do anything. So now that we've gotten this far, it is time to break down some misconceptions.\\nAnyone can learn computer programming; not just the uber-nerds who love to use Linux and collect Star Wars cards.\\nAnyone can learn to sing with skill and confidence. In fact, after several years of high school choir, my buddy (who originally couldn't hold a tune in a bucket), became one of the top singers in our Symphonic Choir.\\nAnyone can be good at math! You don't need a Voyage 200 to rise to the top of your trig class. You don't even need this bad boy (although it may help you attract the ladies).\\nCarol Dweck, who I mentioned above, takes her growth mindset to break other preconceived notions. Practicing what she preached, she took up piano as an adult and learned to speak Italian in her 50's. This stands as a lesson to all adults who push away opportunities, assuming the old dog is unable to learn new tricks. Perhaps one reason that the growth mindset is hard to digest is the fact that it ultimately makes us accountable for our inabilities. It is far easier to ascribe them to a lack of God-given gift than confess that we have chosen to remain incapable. It's a tough pill to swallow but it is one that will do us a world of good. With increasing technology the world is evolving and changing faster than ever before. Futurist Alvin Toffler is quoted saying,\\n\\\"The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.\\\"\\nHaving a growth mindset is more important than it has ever been before. For fear of being left in the dust, I decided that for my \\\"30 days of trying something new\\\" I would learn how to use Drupal. And I'm excited about it! I mean, it's no Mt. Kilimanjaro, but it's a start.\\n*Will you try something new for 30 days? If so, then I commend you!

You put in values, click submit, it interacts with a database, code runs, and you see results. Drupal is no exception. Some forms are longer than otherscough cough, modules pagebut they are forms none-the-less. So naturally, by replacing Drupal's default form elements with newer, more modern alternatives, we can make a big impact on Drupal's user experience. If that's your goal, here are some options worth looking into:&nbsp;<\\/p>\\n\\n<p class=\\\"p1\\\">By default, Drupal gives you three basic multi-select options: checkboxes, autocomplete, and select lists. These can get the job done, but each one has weaknesses.

Physically, he looks just like you'd expect a software engineer to look: Rather portly, with glasses and his brown hair parted to one side. You'd never guess that he had scaled Mt. Kilimanjaro (among other impressive feats).<\\/p>\\n<p>His secret? <a href=\\\"http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Try Something New [VIDEO]\\\">Try something new for 30 days<\\/a>*.<\\/p>\\n<p>He found that you can make yourself do anything for 30 days. If you really stink, you just keep doing it. If you don't like it, you can stop on the 31st day and never do it again. After trying this, he realized that he was capable of much more than he originally thought. What's more, trying new things gave him confidence to pursue more difficult things. Line upon line, he grew by trying new things he never thought he'd be able to do. Fundamentally, he had adopted a &quot;growth mindset&quot;.<\\/p>\\n<p>Stanford Psychologist and <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset_(book)\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\\\">author<\\/a> Carol Dweck has done extensive research on how we perceive talent and skill. <a href=\\\"http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2007/marapr/features/dweck.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Effort and the Growth Mindset\\\">This article from Stanford Magazine<\\/a> discusses <a href=\\\"http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2007/marapr/images/features/dweck/dweck_mindset.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Growth vs Fixed Mindset\\\">differences between those with a growth mindset and those with a fixed mindset<\\/a>. It reads:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote><p>&quot;Take a group of adults and ask them to draw a self-portrait. Most Americans think of drawing as a gift they don&rsquo;t have, and their portraits look no better than a child&rsquo;s scribbles. But put them in a well-designed class... and the resulting portraits look so skilled it&rsquo;s hard to believe they&rsquo;re the work of the same 'talentless' individuals. The belief that you can&rsquo;t improve stunts achievement.&quot;<\\/p>\\n<\\/blockquote>\\n<p>The essence of the growth mindset is that knowledge and skill is dynamic and malleable. People who adopt it believe that their capacities are expandable. They enjoy challenges, seeing them as opportunities to stretch and grow. Others who adopt a fixed mindset prefer to credit innate ability. They believe that natural talent is the best indicator of future success. They say things like &quot;I wish I could understand technology&quot;, or &quot;I'm not a people person&quot;.<\\/p>\\n<p>And they are wrong.<\\/p>\\n<p>They can understand technology. They could be a 'people person'. One BYU article, <a href=\\\"http://ctl.byu.edu/showArchivePage.php?&pageUID=RWE9RzOVdsaW\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"The Growth Mentality\\\">The Growth Mentality<\\/a>, discusses learning from a neuroscience perspective. With each thing we learn, we physically grow new neural pathways in our brain. From a biological perspective, the brain develops like a muscle that grows stronger with exercise. While it is true that some start out with more talent than others, natural talent is only a small part of the equation. Consider the graph below:<\\/p>\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://bryanbraun.com/2011/07/18/the-growth-mindset/skill-time/\\\" rel=\\\"attachment wp-att-588\\\"><img alt=\\\"Skill as a function of Time\\\" class=\\\"size-full wp-image-588 aligncenter diffbot_image\\\" height=\\\"360\\\" src=\\\"http://bryanbraun.com/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/Skill-time.gif\\\" title=\\\"Skill-time\\\" width=\\\"486\\\"><\\/img><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p>The red line represents somebody initially more talented than the blue line. However, blue (who has a growth-mindset), embraces learning to eventually become more skilled than his red compadre (who has a fixed mindset). Far from a pipe dream, this is a real outcome that has been exemplified by Michael Jordan, Thomas Edison, and other <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6hz_s2XIAU\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Famous Failures - YouTube\\\">&quot;famous failures&quot;<\\/a>. Consider the statement made by Heber J. Grant:<\\/p>\\n<blockquote><p>&quot;That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that our power to do is increased&quot; (in Conference Report, Apr. 1901, 63).<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p>This quote lines right up with the concept of <a href=\\\"http://bryanbraun.com/2011/06/06/the-new-york-times-and-the-sticky-platform/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"The New York Times and The Sticky Platform\\\">The Sticky Platform<\\/a>. Hard things aren't hard to the people who learn how to do them. And with the resources we have today, there is nothing preventing us from becoming an <a href=\\\"http://taylor-atkinson.blogspot.com/2011/07/you-are-superman.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"You are Superman\\\">ubermensch<\\/a>. We can do anything. So now that we've gotten this far, it is time to break down some misconceptions.<\\/p>\\n<ul><li>Anyone can learn computer programming; not just the uber-nerds who love to use Linux and collect Star Wars cards.<\\/li>\\n<li>Anyone can learn to sing with skill and confidence. In fact, after several years of high school choir, my buddy (who originally couldn't hold a tune in a bucket), became one of the top singers in our Symphonic Choir.<\\/li>\\n<li>Anyone can be good at math! You don't need a <a href=\\\"http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_v200.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Voyage 200\\\">Voyage 200<\\/a> to rise to the top of your trig class.

Practicing what she preached, she took up piano as an adult and learned to speak Italian in her 50's. This stands as a lesson to all adults who push away opportunities, assuming the old dog is unable to learn new tricks. Perhaps one reason that the growth mindset is hard to digest is the fact that it ultimately makes us accountable for our inabilities. It is far easier to ascribe them to a lack of God-given gift than confess that we have chosen to remain incapable. It's a tough pill to swallow but it is one that will do us a world of good. With increasing technology the world is evolving and changing faster than ever before. Futurist Alvin Toffler is quoted saying,<\\/p>\\n<blockquote><p>&quot;The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.&quot;<\\/p><\\/blockquote>\\n<p>Having a growth mindset is more important than it has ever been before. For fear of being left in the dust, I decided that for my &quot;30 days of trying something new&quot; I would learn how to use <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupal\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Drupal\\\">Drupal<\\/a>. And I'm excited about it! I mean, it's no Mt. Kilimanjaro, but it's a start.<\\/p>\\n<p><small>*Will you try something new for 30 days? If so, then I commend you!

With a man and a woman (for the sake of brevity, I am going to stop saying \\\"heterosexual\\\" every time -- just assume that is what I mean), they themselves may feel confused as to whether or not they want this to be \\\"just business\\\" or if they want a romantic relationship to blossom. Even if they are 100% clear about it, their closeness may create problems because other people may assume there is an affair even if absolutely nothing is going on.\\nI think the essence of The Glass Ceiling boils down to this: My experience is that men are either not very willing to talk to me one-on-one or, if they are, talking shop is the last thing they had in mind. They are looking for romance, not looking to help me professionally. When I say this to other women, they generally express immediate agreement. Men often deny it, criticize it or just stop talking when I say such things.\\nMost professional power and money is in the hands of men. Men in positions of power do not want scandal to smear their name. But they are human. They are not immune to the existence of this gray zone. They are not immune to feeling warm feelings towards a woman at work and wondering if it might be mutual. They are not immune to seeing someone's warm behavior towards them and wondering how to interpret it -- whether it is \\\"just friendly\\\" or whether it is an invitation to a romantic relationship.\\nThis gray zone exists because there is a vast space to cross between just meeting someone and becoming intimate with them, whether romantically or in a platonic but trusting relationship (like a business contact). Even if you decide up front that you are in a relationship, you are not interested, etc. it does not make you immune to the gray zone. Married people sometimes have affairs. People determined to remain alone sometimes happen to fall hard for someone new who has qualities they never expected to find together in one person.\\nI think the path forward is finding a way to tolerate this gray zone and accommodate it without simply shutting women out professionally. So I really do not think these shit shows help women break into business. I think they just reinforce the current paradigm where the people in power -- mostly men -- have reason to err on the side of shutting women out in order to protect themselves from potential scandal or accusations or similar.\\nI don't know for sure what the path forward is. But as I indicated earlier today on HN, I have relatively recently returned to actively participating on HN after leaving in part because I felt being a woman on HN was more down side than up. So, having made the front page three times and having returned to what feels to me like a less hostile environment, I am currently feeling like choices I have made to try to avoid shit shows may be paying off.\\nTime will tell if that (making the front page, feeling more welcomed generally, etc) will last or if I will, at some point, return to feeling like my gender is a show stopping issue on HN.\\nEdit: To my shock, this has been on HN while I was away from keyboard (and puking my guts out, so I am reading the discussion but may not reply to any of it): Linky\\n\\nShare\\n0\\nMore Next Blog\u00bb\\nCreate BlogSign In\\nopen mic\\nThe personal blog of Michele in California\\nHome\\nAbout\\nBooks\\nHN Tools\\nTravel template.

Men in positions of power do not want scandal to smear their name. But they are human. They are not immune to the existence of this gray zone. They are not immune to feeling warm feelings towards a woman at work and wondering if it might be mutual. They are not immune to seeing someone's warm behavior towards them and wondering how to interpret it -- whether it is &quot;just friendly&quot; or whether it is an invitation to a romantic relationship.<br>\\n<br>\\nThis gray zone exists because there is a vast space to cross between just meeting someone and becoming intimate with them, whether romantically or in a platonic but trusting relationship (like a business contact). Even if you decide up front that you are in a relationship, you are not interested, etc. it does not make you immune to the gray zone. Married people sometimes have affairs. People determined to remain alone sometimes happen to fall hard for someone new who has qualities they never expected to find together in one person.<br>\\n<br>\\nI think the path forward is finding a way to tolerate this gray zone and accommodate it without simply shutting women out professionally. So I really do not think these shit shows help women break into business. I think they just reinforce the current paradigm where the people in power -- mostly men -- have reason to err on the side of shutting women out in order to protect themselves from potential scandal or accusations or similar.<br>\\n<br>\\nI don't know for sure what the path forward is. But <a href=\\\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7406399\\\">as I indicated earlier today on HN<\\/a>, I have relatively recently returned to actively participating on HN after leaving in part because I felt being a woman on HN was more down side than up. So, having made the front page three times and having returned to what feels to me like a less hostile environment, I am currently feeling like choices I have made to try to avoid shit shows may be paying off.<br>\\n<br>\\nTime will tell if that (making the front page, feeling more welcomed generally, etc) will last or if I will, at some point, return&nbsp;to feeling like my gender is a show stopping issue on HN. <br>\\n<br>\\nEdit: To my shock, this has been on HN while I was away from keyboard (and puking my guts out, so I am reading the discussion but may not reply to any of it): <a
